## [Unreleased]

## [0.21.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added
- Cohesive CLI journey: `init`, `doctor`, `profile validate/show/diff/migrate`
- Durable workspace defaults (`.etlantic/reports`, `.etlantic/artifacts`) with `--ephemeral` escape hatch
- Optional `etlantic.toml` project config with `profiles/` fallback
- Structured profile assets (`json://path` and `{provider, location}` objects)

- `report list`; cross-invocation `report show`/`export` from file store
- Global CLI options: `--verbose`, `--quiet`, `--color`, `--non-interactive`, `--workspace`
- Documented exit code taxonomy; mutation preamble via `--preview`
- Library modules: `etlantic.workspace`, `etlantic.project`, `etlantic.bindings`
- Docs: What's New 0.21, Migration 0.20→0.21, Exit gate 0.21

### Changed
- Official package versions align at 0.21.0; plugins require `etlantic>=0.21.0,<0.22`
- Legacy profile JSON `bindings` fail closed unless `--accept-legacy-bindings`
- Production profile metadata uses strict extension namespaces by default
- `FileReportStore` exported from `etlantic.reports`
- CLI refactored into shared `CliContext` with unified output helpers

### Deprecated
- `reliability plan-diff` in favor of `plan diff`

### Migration
- See `docs/11_DEVELOPMENT/MIGRATION_0_20_TO_0_21.md`

## [0.20.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- Pre-import plugin lifecycle: `discover → evaluate → authorize → load`
- Static `etlantic.plugin_manifest/1` for first-party plugins (no entry-point import)
- Optional isolated capability probe with time/output budgets
- Unified `SafeIoPolicy` (roots, symlinks, special files, atomic writes, locks, digests)
- Artifact/cache isolation dimensions: tenant, environment, authorization, run, contract version
- Default-deny `OutboundPolicy` for Emit/webhook/remote-reference destinations
- Unsafe-serialization prohibitions (`PMSEC060`)
- Versioned `SecurityEvent` schema (`etlantic.security_event/1`) for auth/I/O/network/probe
- Profile fields: `tenant`, `environment`, `safe_io`, `outbound`, `require_plugin_probe`
- Release SBOM digests, GitHub build provenance attestations, OIDC-preferred publish
- Docs: What's New 0.20, Migration 0.19→0.20, Exit gate matrix

### Changed
- Official package versions align at 0.20.0; plugins require `etlantic>=0.20.0,<0.21`
- Discovery modules authorize before `ep.load()`; production requires manifests
- Report and schema-history file stores write through `SafeIoPolicy`

### Fixed
- Allowlisted plugins can no longer be selected after an unauthorized import
- Cross-domain artifact/cache identity collisions fail closed

### Migration
- See `docs/11_DEVELOPMENT/MIGRATION_0_19_TO_0_20.md`

## [0.19.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- Contract and configuration freeze: deep plan immutability helpers, fingerprint
  verification at deserialize/compile/run trust boundaries
- Explicit `Profile.security_mode` (`development` | `test` | `production`)
- Strict named profile resolution with `--allow-adhoc-profile` / `allow_adhoc_profile`
- Diagnosed legacy profile JSON `bindings` loads; nested wire schema tightening
- Extension metadata namespace/budget helpers; public surface inventory
- Pre-1.0 deprecation schedule for remaining provisional surfaces
- Optional experimental `etlantic-datafusion` package (non-blocking Gate B)

### Changed
- Official package versions align at 0.19.0; plugins require
  `etlantic>=0.19.0,<0.20`
- Production fail-closed trust/drift uses `security_mode == "production"` only
- Unknown bare profile names fail closed unless ad hoc is explicitly allowed
- Plan and run-report loaders reject missing or unknown wire `schema` values

### Fixed
- Nested plan-owned mappings can no longer be mutated after construction
- Tampered plan fingerprints fail before compilation or execution

### Migration
- See `docs/11_DEVELOPMENT/MIGRATION_0_18_TO_0_19.md`

## [0.18.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- Gate A versioned tabular interchange with immutable
  `etlantic.interchange/1` plan descriptors
- Capability-driven mechanism selection for Arrow C Data/C Stream, Arrow IPC,
  Parquet artifacts, and explicit records/native fallbacks
- Bounded fidelity, ownership, copy, cleanup, and run-report evidence models
- Polars↔Pandas cross-engine conformance coverage and public testing helpers
- What's New 0.18 and Migration 0.17 → 0.18

### Changed
- Cross-engine dataframe boundaries can be planned and validated independently
  of hard-coded engine-name pairs
- Stored 0.17 plans must be regenerated to obtain interchange descriptors
- Official package versions align at 0.18.0; plugins require
  `etlantic>=0.18.0,<0.19`
- Arrow-assisted conversion remains available only as a legacy best-effort
  helper; Gate A descriptors are the versioned contract

### Fixed
- Interchange execution now fails closed when a selected mechanism, fidelity
  bound, or ownership requirement cannot be honored
- Plan explain and runtime evidence consistently report Gate A selection and
  fallback decisions without embedding rows or secrets
- Spark MERGE/UPSERT fails closed when Delta is unavailable, `merge_keys` are
  missing, or `delta-spark` is not installed (no parquet overwrite fallback);
  the local orchestrator raises on Spark write error diagnostics
- Production schema-drift BLOCK uses the same production-profile detection as
  plugin trust (`prod` / `staging` / security-domain aliases)
- Schema history refuses row-like payloads in observation and schema metadata,
  on disk load, and in in-memory history
- CLI `generate --sqlmodel` emits real SQLModel source; `reliability freshness`
  fails closed without `--observed-age`; `diff` reports per-side load errors;
  `plugin info` honors profile allowlists and supports scheduler plugins
- Documentation, contributor checks, and ROADMAP status aligned for 0.18.0
  (including `asset=` authoring and current install pins)
- Restore `examples/quickstart.py` `run_example()` entry point required by CI

## [0.17.0] - 2026-07-19

ETLantic 0.17.0 is production/stable within the documented single-tenant
reference envelope. Experimental features and adopter-owned deployment,
compliance, and supply-chain controls remain outside that support claim. See
See `docs/11_DEVELOPMENT/MIGRATION_0_16_TO_0_17.md`.

### Added
- Graduated portable families on Polars and PySpark: string-advanced,
  conversion, statistics, window/1, complex-types, complex-values, reshape
- Executable rich-family public conformance fixtures and coverage enforcement
- `etlantic plugin list --kind transform_compiler` capability inventory
- `scripts/check_transform_compiler_drift.py` packaging/guide drift gate
- What's New 0.17 and Migration 0.16 → 0.17
- Example `examples/portable_wave17.py`

### Changed
- Window V1 authoring emits `portable-window/1` only (V2 functions stay V2)
- Complex-type accessors no longer force complex-values requirements; `explode`
  emits reshape only
- Transform-compiler discovery uses entry-point names as stable keys; validate,
  plan, and run all respect profile allowlists
- Distinct missing/invalid literals fail closed without `three_state_distinct`
- Explicit window frames and windowed aggregates fail closed at analyze
- SQL portable compiler advertises `lazy=False` and honors action `target`
- Package versions aligned at 0.17.0; plugins require `etlantic>=0.17.0,<0.18`

### Fixed
- Validate-path unfiltered transform-compiler discovery bypass of allowlists
- PySpark Wave 1/2 function inventory and lowering parity with matrix claims
- PySpark `explode` empty/null row parity (`explode_outer`)
- Polars multi-key rank truncation, bare rank placeholder, soft `to_integer`,
  and over-broad null-safe join `TypeError` fallback
- Pandas 2-arg `substr` first-row-only start index
- SQL analyze/execute gaps for predicate joins and byPosition
  `allowMissingColumns`
- Documentation and release-checklist drift for the published 0.17.0 support
  envelope (bounded production/stable posture, install pins, Prefect status,
  MkDocs navigation, and docs/release drift checks)

## [0.16.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- Optional `etlantic-prefect` `ExecutionScheduler` plugin (Prefect 3.x local MVP)
- `etlantic.scheduler_plugins` discovery and `Profile(orchestrator=...)` run dispatch
- Public `etlantic.testing.run_scheduler_conformance_suite`
- Migration guide 0.15 → 0.16

### Changed
- Removed public `Source` / `Sink` / `binding=` / `Profile(bindings=...)` /
  `RunRequest(binding_overrides=...)` authoring aliases (Gate A)
- Profile public JSON emits `assets` only; plan snapshots keep wire `bindings`
- Package versions aligned at 0.16.0; plugins require `etlantic>=0.16.0,<0.17`

### Fixed
- Embedded plugin/compiler `__version__` values that still advertised `0.15.0`
  (broke production allowlist pins and plan plugin metadata)
- Clear `AttributeError` migration messages for `etlantic.Source` / `etlantic.Sink`
- Prefect wave runner no longer blocks the event loop on sync `Future.result()`
- Host `run_id` is threaded through `SchedulingContext` into Prefect/local hosts
- Documentation, SECURITY support table, and release checklist drift after the
  0.16 ship (including Prefect in published package lists)

### Migration
- Prefer `Extract` / `Load` / `asset=` / `Profile(assets=...)`. See
  `docs/11_DEVELOPMENT/MIGRATION_0_15_TO_0_16.md`.
- Use `Profile(orchestrator="prefect")` only with `etlantic-prefect` installed.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Safe SQL Lowering: `etlantic-sql` portable transform compiler claiming
  kernel + `portable-relational/1`, lowering DTCS plans into typed
  `etlantic.sql/1` IR with bound parameters and `PMXFORM*` analyze findings
- Expanded SQL IR (joins, unions, group/order, CTEs, call/case/unary exprs)
  and dialect compiler coverage for the relational `/1` surface
- Public SQL portable conformance + Polars differential suite; portable SQL
  security corpus (no interpolation; trusted fragments forbidden)
- Built-in `LocalScheduler` (`etlantic.scheduler/1`) as the
  `Pipeline.run` / `arun` entrypoint; private scheduler conformance corpus;
  Prefect feasibility spike notes (package deferred to 0.16)
- Canonical `Extract` / `Load` / `asset=` authoring with warned
  `Source` / `Sink` / `binding=` compatibility through 0.16
- `Profile.assets` and `RunRequest.asset_overrides` (legacy aliases warned);
  fingerprint-stable bindings-only `profile_snapshot`
- `docs/01_GETTING_STARTED/WHATS_NEW_0_15.md` and SQL column in the portable
  compiler matrix

### Changed

- Package version set to 0.15.0 across core and optional plugins
- Official plugin dependencies bound to `etlantic>=0.15.0,<0.16`
- Clarified that advanced portable profile graduation remains **0.15
  continuation** (not part of this exit gate)

### Upgrade notes

- Pin `etlantic==0.15.0` and matching plugins. Prefer `Extract`/`Load`/
  `asset=` / `Profile.assets`. See
  `docs/11_DEVELOPMENT/MIGRATION_0_14_TO_0_15.md`.
- Portable SQL requires `etlantic-sql`; use
  `run_portable_transform_conformance_suite` for third-party SQL compilers.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- `etlantic-pandas` portable transform compiler claiming kernel +
  `portable-relational/1` (eager-only, index-neutral) with
  `etlantic.transform_compilers` entry point `pandas`
- Public `etlantic.testing.portable_transform_conformance` suite with
  capability-selected fixtures and
  `run_portable_transform_conformance_suite`
- Hypothesis property tests for capability matching, null-aware boolean
  semantics, and compile fingerprint stability
- Expanded Polars ↔ Pandas differentials (Unicode/ordering, unequal-key joins)
- CI runs pandas compiler suites, public conformance for Polars/Pandas/PySpark,
  and three-engine differentials
- `python -m etlantic` entry via `src/etlantic/__main__.py`
- Profile JSON path loading for `--profile ./profiles/prod.json`
- `py.typed` markers for core and every official plugin package

### Fixed

- Durable `PipelineRunReport.from_dict` round-trips lineage, diagnostics,
  validations, schema observations, step timings, and duration
- Soft-skip no longer clears unrelated pending sibling branches; `CONTINUE`
  allows dependents while `SKIP` abandons only transitive consumers
- Step timeouts invoke failure callbacks / retry policy instead of bypassing them
- Profile JSON loading rejects plaintext secrets, missing `.json` paths, and
  unknown `with_updates` keys; string capability lists are not character-split
- Validate/plan/exec honor `plugin_allowlist` for selected engines and
  transform compilers (`PMPLUG402` when listed plugins are rejected)
- Pandas unequal-key joins preserve left columns named like `rightKey`;
  semi/anti use stable suffixes; cross joins use native `how="cross"`
- PySpark unequal-key joins rename colliding right keys before coalesce
- PySpark substring lowering passes integer bounds on real Spark as required by
  PySpark 3.x while preserving DTCS zero-based indexing

### Documentation

- Full 0.14 published-alpha docs overhaul: What’s New, migrations, pilot /
  production-profile / durable-reports cookbooks, compiler matrix, optional
  packages page, honest CLI/file-storage claims, and MkDocs nav restructure
- Marked roadmap 0.14 shipped; updated capabilities, Pandas, testing plugins,
  and compiler protocol docs for the public conformance SDK

### Changed

- Package version set to 0.14.0 across core and optional plugins
- Official plugin dependencies bound to `etlantic>=0.14.0,<0.15`
- `etlantic-pandas` requires `pandas>=2.2,<3` (matches `include_groups=`)

### Upgrade notes

- Pin `etlantic==0.14.0` and matching plugins. Extras pins use `==0.14.0`.
- Third-party transform compilers should run
  `run_portable_transform_conformance_suite` against their advertised claims.
- Pandas portable plans that previously required native `@implementation`
  under `portable_transform_policy="require"` now compile when they fit
  kernel + relational `/1`.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Polars compiler claims `dtcs:profile/portable-relational/1` (join, union,
  aggregate, sort, distinct, deduplicate, limit) with mode-exact `analyze()`
  findings and expression/action paths
- `etlantic-pyspark` `etlantic.transform_compilers` entry point claiming kernel
  + relational `/1`; native Column/DataFrame lowering with portable-path UDF deny
- Orchestrator support for `portable_compiled` Spark steps (provider session,
  outside region UDF fusion)
- Private Polars↔PySpark differential corpus and gated `real_pyspark`
  Catalyst/no-UDF acceptance marker
- Relational `/1`↔`/2` capability alias matching (metadata compatibility; no
  candidate `/2` extensions)

### Documentation

- Refined roadmap 0.13 into locked decisions + 0.13a (Polars relational) /
  0.13b (PySpark + differentials); deferred public conformance to 0.14
- Updated capabilities, compatibility, Polars/PySpark, and compiler protocol
  docs for shipped relational claims

### Changed

- Package version set to 0.13.0 across core and optional plugins

### Fixed

- PySpark portable joins coalesce unequal keys like Polars (drop right key cols)
- Join `collisionPolicy` fail-closed to `fail` only (suffix/coalesce deferred)
- PySpark `with_fields` replaces existing columns instead of duplicating them
- Polars `unionByName` aligns by name (and fills missing when allowed)
- Semi/anti joins no longer false-fail on non-key column name overlap
- PySpark `substr` uses 0-based portable offsets; `replace` is literal
- Empty Spark DataFrames use an empty `StructType` instead of `schema=None`
- Analyze rejects `with_fields` windows and `allowMissingColumns` on byPosition
- CI runs `polars_compiler`, `pyspark_compiler`, and portable differentials

### Upgrade notes

- Pin `etlantic==0.13.0` and matching plugins (`etlantic-polars`,
  `etlantic-pyspark`, …). Extras pins use `==0.13.0`.
- Portable join/union/aggregate/sort/dedupe/limit plans that failed planning in
  0.12 under `portable_transform_policy="require"` now compile on Polars and
  PySpark when they fit `portable-relational/1`.
- PySpark portable compilation forbids automatic UDF fallback; keep native
  `@implementation("pyspark")` when you need UDFs or unclaimed profiles.
- Public `etlantic.testing.portable_transform_conformance` remains deferred to
  0.14; private differential fixtures live under `tests/`.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- `etlantic.transform-compiler/1` protocol types, discovery
  (`etlantic.transform_compilers`), and capability matching
- `Profile.portable_transform_policy` (`prefer` / `require` / `native`) with
  fail-closed unsupported diagnostics (`PMXFORM3xx`)
- `ImplementationDescriptor.kind` (`portable_compiled` | `native`) with
  embedded bounded IR, fingerprints, compiler identity, and fallback reason
- `plan explain` fields for compiler selection, IR fingerprint, and requirements
- Polars kernel compiler (`create_transform_compiler`) claiming
  `dtcs:profile/portable-relational-kernel/1` with `pl.Expr` / LazyFrame lowering
- Runtime path executing portable_compiled dataframe steps without a native
  transformation callable
- `examples/portable_polars_kernel.py` runnable portable kernel quickstart

### Documentation

- Refined roadmap 0.12: planning (0.12a) + Polars kernel-only compiler (0.12b);
  locked prefer policy, embedded IR, and 0.13/0.14 deferrals
- Marked compiler protocol and Polars kernel execution as shipped in 0.12
- Treated 0.12.0 as the published current line across guides, banners, support,
  navigation, migration, and examples
- Added Migration 0.11 → 0.12, maintainers / CODEOWNERS / issue+PR templates,
  and release smoke-before-publish ordering

### Changed

- Package version set to 0.12.0 across core and optional plugins
- Release publish paces only brand-new PyPI project creates (existing projects
  upload immediately) so partial releases can finish without multi-hour sleeps

### Fixed

- Polars lowering unwraps DTCS typed literals (avoid Struct `pl.lit` payloads)
- `concat_ws` / `round` / string search helpers require Python constants, not Expr
- Reject unclaimed `dtcs:cast` in kernel compiler (no silent no-op)
- Capability matching fail-closes on empty action/function claims
- Planner defers native auto-pick until after portable analyze (no phantom natives)
- Validate `require` policy analyzes portable IR instead of fail-opening on compiler presence
- Compiler `analyze` unions plan-derived requirements; compile collects parameter fieldRefs
- Warn when multiple transform compilers register the same engine
- Accept authored DTCS op names (`not_eq`/`subtract`/`multiply`/`divide`, unary `expr`)
- Registry natives no longer bypass prefer/require portable analyze
- Window metadata on kernel plans fail-closed (profile + runtime reject)
- Project expression fields require aliases; authoring mints `_col_N` when missing
- Output schemas preserve contract field types when subsetting by `schema_fields`
- Runtime resolves planned `compiler_name`/`version`; portable_compiled requires dataframe engine

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- `@Transformation.portable` symbolic authoring over `etlantic.transform`
  (`FrameExpr`, `ColumnExpr`, `functions as F`, `Window`, complex/lambda helpers)
- Emission of validated, fingerprint-stable `dtcs.transform-plan/2` plans for
  Portable Relational and Rich Portable Analytics profile families
- `Transformation.to_transform_plan()` / `portable_fingerprint()` APIs
- `PMXFORM` authoring diagnostics and definition budgets
- Golden portable fixtures under `tests/fixtures/portable/`

### Fixed

- Portable join/union/set-ops no longer drop sibling actions via colliding
  `aN_*` IDs; unequal ID collisions fail closed (`PMXFORM210`)
- `sort` / `orderBy` / `Window.orderBy` treat bare strings as fieldRefs, not
  string literals
- Window metadata survives wrappers such as `F.to_string(... .over(w))`
- `to_transform_plan()` returns a deep copy so callers cannot mutate the cache
- COM parameter types map from `Parameter` annotations (not always `string`)
- Window frame bounds coerce expression nodes to JSON-safe values
- Production `plugin_allowlist` enforced on validate / run / compile; bare
  version pins accepted as `==version`; `plugin list` exits non-zero on ERROR
- Declared vs observed schema type aliases (`int`/`integer`, …) no longer
  report false breaking drift
- Planner and SparkForge adapter metadata versions track 0.11.0

### Documentation

- Marked portable authoring as shipped in 0.11; compilers remain 0.12–0.15
- Refined roadmap 0.11 to full authoring scope and marked the milestone shipped
- Rolled current-facing docs and install pins from 0.10 → 0.11; hardened
  `scripts/check_docs.py` stale-version gates
- Adoption pass: portable authoring SSOT, Current 0.11 nav, Quickstart CLI
  continuation, Migration 0.10→0.11, Ops Pilot, FAQ positioning, transform API
  / CLI gaps, check_docs gates

### Changed

- Package version set to 0.11.0 across core and optional plugins
- Raised the DTCS toolkit dependency floor from 0.12 to 0.13 (carried from
  unreleased 0.10 docs integration)

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Optional `etlantic-sparkforge` migration adapter (IR → Pipeline / Profile)

- Migration guide `docs/11_DEVELOPMENT/MIGRATION_0_9_TO_0_10.md`
- Runnable docs guides for Airflow compile and SparkForge adapter
- Docs status SSOT via CAPABILITIES + expanded `scripts/check_docs.py` guards

### Changed

- Package version advances to 0.10 (SparkForge Migration Preview)
- Plugin packages require `etlantic>=0.10.0,<1.0`
- SparkForge adoption checklist prerequisites marked complete
- Release workflow paces PyPI uploads (10 minutes between packages)
- Install docs are pip-first now that `0.10.0` is on PyPI
- Agent guidance lists `etlantic.viz` and optional `etlantic-airflow` for compile

### Fixed

- Schema history refuses row-like metadata by key (no substring false positives)
- Core `redact_message` / `redact_value` cover HTTPS basic-auth and string leaves
- SparkForge report adapter redacts free-text errors, Bearer tokens, and DSNs
- `strict_delta=False` emits warnings for missing Delta capabilities (PMSF323)
- SparkForge IR missing step names emit `PMSF310` instead of raising `KeyError`
- Retry policy mapping clamps `max_attempts` to at least 1
- Unknown validation policy names fail closed (`KeyError`) instead of inventing
  empty policies
- Testing helpers harden write-semantics, orchestrator secret scans, and missing
  secret fail-closed behavior
- Adapter stops importing private `_PipelineNamespace`
- Docs SSOT: Graphviz/HTML/lineage, Spark, Airflow, and Mermaid status drift

### Upgrade notes

- Install `etlantic-sparkforge` (or `etlantic[sparkforge]`) for the adapter
- ETLantic core remains free of bronze / silver / gold types
- Full SparkForge engine retirement remains a progressive path (see migration guide)
- Prefer `git tag v0.10.0 && git push origin v0.10.0` (not `git push --tags`)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- CLI wrappers: `compile`, `generate`, `diff`, `plugin list|info`, schema family,
  reliability ops, viz exporters, and `report compare`

- Migration guide `docs/11_DEVELOPMENT/MIGRATION_0_8_TO_0_9.md`

### Changed

- Package version advances to 0.9 (Tooling, SDK, and Ecosystem Readiness)
- Plugin packages require `etlantic>=0.9.0,<1.0`
- Graphviz / HTML / lineage docs promoted out of Future Design

### Upgrade notes

- Production profiles should set `plugin_allowlist` explicitly
- Schema history stores fingerprints only — never source rows
- Core remains free of Airflow, Spark, SQL drivers, SQLModel, keyring, and OTel
  unless extras / optional packages are installed

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-17

### Upgrade notes

- Install `etlantic-sql` separately; core stays driver-free
- Register SQL implementations with
  `@TransformationClass.implementation("sql")`
- Set `Profile(sql_engine="sql")` to select the SQL backend
- Configure connections via `ETLANTIC_SQL_URL` (or plugin-specific wiring)
- Missing plugins or unsupported capabilities (e.g. MERGE without keys) fail
  at validation/planning

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- Versioned dataframe execution protocol (`etlantic.dataframe/1`) with
  materialize → invoke → normalize → validate → metrics → cleanup phases
- Expanded capability vocabulary: eager, lazy, Arrow import/export, zero-copy,
  schema inspection, invalid-row separation, cancellation, thread-safety
- Planner recording of engine, plugin version, capabilities, collection points,
  conversion boundaries, ownership, and validation policy on `PipelinePlan`
- Runtime delegation of Polars/Pandas steps through the dataframe protocol
  without reselecting engines
- Independently installable `etlantic-polars` (eager + LazyFrame preservation)
  and `etlantic-pandas` (eager, CoW/ownership isolation)
- Optional Arrow interchange helpers (PyArrow imported only when available)
- Entry-point discovery group `etlantic.dataframe_plugins`
- Conformance helpers in `etlantic.testing`
- uv workspace packaging for core + dataframe plugins

### Changed

- Package version advances to 0.5 (Dataframe Execution)
- Built-in `local` registry plugin is a runtime/records path (`dataframe=False`),
  not a dataframe engine
- Planning contexts for `polars`/`pandas` auto-require dataframe capabilities

### Upgrade notes

- Install `etlantic-polars` or `etlantic-pandas` separately; core stays
  engine-free
- Register dataframe implementations with
  `@TransformationClass.implementation("polars")` or `"pandas"`
- Set `Profile.dataframe_engine` to `"polars"` or `"pandas"` to select a backend
- Missing plugins or unsupported capabilities (e.g. Pandas + lazy) fail at
  validation/planning

### Fixed

- Default `Pipeline.run` / CLI planning now uses plugins discovered on
  `PipelineRuntime` (and entry-point discovery for plan-only contexts)
- Fan-out / unconsumed / cross-engine ports map to in-memory strategies instead
  of durable records; durable conversion only follows durable strategies
- Per-port collect and validation; quarantine/reject populate invalid artifacts
  and metrics
- Schema observation uses plugin `inspect_schema` for native frames
- Durable `ArtifactStore` refuses native frames/LazyFrames (fail closed)
- Discovery load failures emit warnings; LazyFrame dtype checks without row
  collect; invoke kwargs prefer inputs over colliding parameters
- Core `from_arrow_table` no longer imports Polars/Pandas

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-16

### Upgrade notes

- Register local executable transformations with
  `@TransformationClass.implementation("local")`.
- Use the `development` profile for the built-in local runtime examples.
- Pandas, Polars, SQL, Spark, and Airflow plugins are not part of this release.

### Known limitations

- The local report store is process-scoped.
- The package remains alpha and 0.x releases may contain breaking changes.

### Added

- Local async-first runtime that executes `PipelinePlan`s in-process
- `Pipeline.run` / `Pipeline.arun` / `Pipeline.debug` entry points
- `RunIntent`, `RunSelection`, `RunRequest`, and materialization/retry/timeout
  policies
- `PipelineRuntime` with lifespan, middleware, resource injection, callbacks,
  and outbound event types
- Runtime-only `SecretValue` with env and mounted-file `SecretProvider`s,
  bounded cache, and fail-closed resolution (planning remains secret-free)
- Storage bindings: `memory`, `callable`, `json`, `csv`, and `null` (no-write)
- Versioned `PipelineRunReport` with text/JSON/HTML renderers and in-process
  report store
- Structured logging with central secret redaction and lifecycle/security events
- `SchemaDriftPolicy` observation hooks and local reliability helpers
  (freshness, partition completeness, retry-safety, backfill/repair/no-write)
- CLI: `etlantic run` and `etlantic report show|export`
- Hard dependency on `anyio` for structured concurrency

### Fixed

- Durable materialization no longer always writes workspace files; strategy
  comes from the plan/request
- Missing transformation implementations fail closed (no silent identity
  fallback or engine swap)
- Cancellation uses `anyio` cancelled-exc handling and returns a partial report
- Exception and diagnostic messages are redacted before entering reports/logs
- Binding `SecretRef` values are passed into storage context; unresolved
  secrets still fail closed
- Plan `retry_max_attempts` / `timeout_seconds` merge into default `RunRequest`
  policies
- Planner default binding provider is `memory` (`local`/`python` remain aliases)
- Binding overrides resolve registry descriptors for provider/location/secret
- Retry honors backoff/`retry_on` and retry-safety declarations; `CONTINUE`
  soft-skips without failing the step status as hard failure
- Schema observations fingerprint observed data (not only the contract class)
- CLI `run` prints embedded reports on `PipelineExecutionError`
- Debug session invalidation clears shared artifact/memory state across reruns
- Resource `Inject` wiring, outbound `Emit` capture, report lineage, and
  run/region lifespan helpers

### Changed

- Package version and public status advance to 0.4 (Local Runtime and
  Operational Model)
- `SecretRef` lives under the `etlantic.secrets` package alongside runtime
  secret resolution types

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- `Data` as the preferred thin facade over ContractModel (`DataContractModel`
  remains as a deprecated alias)
- Multi-phase validation (structural, reference, semantic, policy, capability)
  with diagnostic actions and source symbols
- `Profile` templates, `SecretRef`, scoped registries, and capability negotiation
- Immutable secret-free `PipelinePlan` IR (`etlantic.plan/1`) with slicing,
  explain output, and canonical fingerprints
- Schema-drift models (`NormalizedSchema`, observations, changes, `DriftImpact`)
- Portable reliability/intent models (freshness, write/materialization intents,
  idempotency, evidence schemas)
- JSON Schemas for profiles, project config, and PipelinePlan
- `etlantic` CLI: `validate`, `inspect`, `plan`, and `plan explain`
  (plus `plan --explain` alias, `--nodes`, and mutual exclusion for
  `--run-one` / `--run-until`)
- `Pipeline.plan()` / `Pipeline.explain_plan()`

### Fixed

- `run_until` selects declaration-order prefix (not only upstream closure)
- Unknown plan selections fail closed with `PMPLAN501`
- Multi-engine regions and cross-engine durable artifact strategies
- Profile snapshot included in plan fingerprint
- Strict policy requires registered transformation implementations
- Subpipeline validation inherits parent planning context
- Plan JSON round-trip restores `secret_ref` and verifies fingerprints
- Schema-only DTCS ports map `datetime`/`decimal`/`binary` correctly
- Diff APIs return diagnostics for malformed toolkit input

### Changed

- Package version and public status advance to 0.3 (Validation and Pipeline Plan IR)
- Explicit `click` dependency for the CLI plan command group (Typer 0.15+ no
  longer pulls it in transitively)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- Contract interoperability for ODCS (via ContractModel), DTCS, and DPCS
- `Transformation.to_dtcs` / `from_dtcs` and `Pipeline.to_dpcs` / `from_dpcs`
- Deterministic `ContractBundle` generation via `generate_contracts` /
  `write_contracts` / `load_bundle`
- ODCS facades `load_data_contract` and `write_odcs`
- Diff hooks: `diff_data_contracts`, `diff_transformations`, `diff_pipelines`
- Supported-version policy, bounded safe loaders, and source-aware diagnostics
- Dependencies on the published `dtcs` and `dpcs` toolkits

### Fixed

- Map ContractModel `number`/`datetime` fields to DTCS `decimal`/`datetime`
- Emit transformation parameters as `etlantic:parameters` (toolkit-valid)
- Round-trip DPCS step parameter overrides
- Treat matching published ODCS ids as compatible in `PMPIPE210` checks
- Recursively validate nested subpipelines
- Clear stale cyclic graph-build errors on fresh `build_graph()`
- Fail closed on DPCS diff incompatible categories and bad DTCS parse input
- Detect published-id / filename slug collisions during bundle generation
- Resolve `odcs:`-prefixed contract registry keys in `from_dtcs`
- Expose `ValidationReport.has_errors` for the documented validation UX
- Correct getting-started imports to use `etlantic.DataContractModel`
  (ContractModel does not export `DataContractModel`)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- First public release as **ETLantic** (PyPI package `etlantic`)
- Typed modeling kernel for authoring pipelines without an execution backend
- `Transformation`, `Input`, `Output`, and `Parameter` port annotations
- `Pipeline`, `Source`, `Step`, `Sink`, and subpipeline composition
- Typed `OutputRef` wiring with stable node and port identities
- Structural validation diagnostics (cycles, missing refs, incompatible ports)
- Logical graph inspection and Mermaid diagram generation
- ContractModel integration boundary via `DataContractModel` alias
- uv + ruff toolchain, MkDocs documentation site, shared GitHub Actions
  checks, and tag-triggered PyPI release
