# Error Handling

Error handling in PipelineModel is designed to make failures predictable,
typed, and portable across execution backends.

PipelineModel distinguishes between **modeling errors**, **planning errors**,
and **runtime errors**. The core framework coordinates how errors are reported,
while execution plugins provide backend-specific details.

## Goals

Error handling should:

- Produce clear, actionable diagnostics.
- Fail early whenever possible.
- Preserve typed context.
- Remain execution-engine independent.
- Support synchronous and asynchronous execution.
- Integrate with callbacks and retry policies.

## Error Categories

### Model Errors

Detected while defining contracts, transformations, or pipelines.

Examples:

- Invalid type annotations
- Duplicate transformation outputs
- Missing required inputs
- Invalid contract metadata

These should be reported before planning.

### Planning Errors

Detected while building an execution plan.

Examples:

- Incompatible contracts
- Missing implementation
- Unsupported plugin capability
- Circular pipeline dependencies
- Missing runtime resources

Planning errors prevent execution.

### Runtime Errors

Occur while executing a valid plan.

Examples:

- Transformation exceptions
- Database failures
- Network timeouts
- Filesystem errors
- Unexpected plugin failures

Runtime errors may trigger retries or callbacks.

## Typed Error Context

Errors should be exposed through structured context objects instead of raw
exceptions.

Typical context includes:

- Pipeline ID
- Transformation ID
- Contract identity
- Execution profile
- Run ID
- Original exception
- Diagnostics
- Timestamp

## Error Flow

```text

Create Typed Context
   │
   ▼
Invoke Callbacks
   │
   ▼
Determine Action
   │
   ▼
Plugin Executes Action
```

## Retry

Retry decisions should be declarative.

Conceptually:

```python
from pipelinemodel import RetryAction

return RetryAction.retry(max_attempts=3)
```

The execution backend performs the retry according to the active profile.

## Diagnostics

Errors should provide:

- Stable error code
- Human-readable message
- Severity
- Suggested remediation
- Related contract or transformation
- Stack trace (when appropriate)

## Logging

PipelineModel should emit structured logs.

Sensitive values should be redacted according to contract metadata and profile
settings.

## Best Practices

- Prefer typed exceptions and diagnostics.
- Fail during planning instead of execution when possible.
- Keep retry logic declarative.
- Use callbacks for operational responses.
- Preserve original exceptions for debugging.

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid:

- Raising untyped exceptions from public APIs.
- Hiding planning failures until runtime.
- Logging sensitive data by default.
- Embedding backend-specific exceptions in transformation contracts.

## Key Principle

> Errors are part of the execution model, not the transformation contract.
> PipelineModel standardizes how failures are represented while plugins
> determine how backend-specific failures are handled.

errors by validating contracts and transformation interfaces before execution.
