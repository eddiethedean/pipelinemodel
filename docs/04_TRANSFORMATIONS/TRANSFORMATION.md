# Transformation

A `Transformation` defines the logical interface of a data operation.

Like a FastAPI endpoint, a Transformation declares **what it accepts** and
**what it produces** using Python type annotations. It does not describe how
the work is executed.

Execution implementations are registered separately, allowing the same
transformation contract to run on different execution engines.

## Design Goals

A transformation should:

- Be strongly typed.
- Be independent of execution technology.
- Clearly declare inputs, outputs, and parameters.
- Generate a DTCS artifact.
- Support multiple interchangeable implementations.

## Basic Example

```python
from pipelantic import Input, Output, Parameter, Transformation

class NormalizeCustomers(Transformation):
    customers: Input[RawCustomer]
    minimum_age: Parameter[int] = 18
    result: Output[Customer]
```

The declaration is the contract.

## Inputs

Inputs describe the logical datasets consumed by the transformation.

```python
customers: Input[RawCustomer]
```

Each input references a `Data` and is validated during planning.

## Outputs

Outputs describe the datasets produced by the transformation.

```python
result: Output[Customer]
```

Pipelantic validates that downstream consumers are compatible with the
declared output contract.

## Parameters

Parameters configure behavior without becoming part of the pipeline graph.

```python
minimum_age: Parameter[int] = 18
```

Parameters are strongly typed and participate in validation and documentation.

## Implementations

A transformation may have multiple implementations.

```python
@NormalizeCustomers.implementation("polars")
def normalize(customers, minimum_age):
    ...
```

```python
@NormalizeCustomers.implementation("pandas")
def normalize(customers, minimum_age):
    ...
```

The transformation contract remains unchanged while execution varies.

## Synchronous and Asynchronous Execution

Pipelantic supports both:

```python
@NormalizeCustomers.implementation("polars")
def normalize(...):
    ...
```

```python
@NormalizeCustomers.implementation("remote")
async def normalize(...):
    ...
```

The framework normalizes invocation internally.

## Relationship to DTCS

Every transformation can be represented as a DTCS artifact.

```text
Python Transformation
        │
        ▼
DTCS Transformation Contract
```

Python is the preferred authoring experience.
DTCS is the portable representation.

## Validation

Pipelantic validates:

- Input contract compatibility
- Output contract compatibility
- Parameter types
- Implementation signatures
- Plugin capability requirements

Validation occurs before execution planning.

## Planning

Transformations become nodes in the pipeline graph.

During planning, Pipelantic resolves:

- Dependencies
- Runtime bindings
- Execution profiles
- Plugin selection
- Validation requirements

## Best Practices

- Use one transformation per logical operation.
- Keep transformation contracts stable.
- Separate interface from implementation.
- Prefer typed parameters over unstructured dictionaries.
- Support multiple execution engines where practical.

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid:

- Embedding execution-specific logic in the contract.
- Referencing dataframe libraries in transformation interfaces.
- Duplicating schema information already defined by data contracts.
- Mixing orchestration concerns into transformations.

## Key Principle

> A Transformation describes **what** a data operation does. Implementations
describe **how** it runs.

## Next Step

Continue with [Inputs](INPUTS.md) and [Outputs](OUTPUTS.md) to learn how typed
ports define the boundaries between transformations.
