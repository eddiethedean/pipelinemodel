# Implementations

An implementation provides the executable behavior for a `Transformation`.

Transformations describe **what** a data operation does. Implementations describe
**how** it is executed for a particular runtime.

This separation is one of Pipelantic's core architectural principles.

## Interface vs. Implementation

```python
class NormalizeCustomers(Transformation):
    customers: Input[RawCustomer]
    minimum_age: Parameter[int] = 18
    result: Output[Customer]
```

The class above is the transformation contract.

Execution is provided separately.

```python
@NormalizeCustomers.implementation("polars")
def normalize(customers, minimum_age):
    ...
```

## Why Separate Them?

Keeping implementations separate allows:

- Multiple execution engines
- Easier testing
- Runtime portability
- Cleaner contracts
- Better documentation
- Independent optimization

## Multiple Implementations

A single transformation may target several runtimes.

```python
@NormalizeCustomers.implementation("polars")
def normalize(...):
    ...

@NormalizeCustomers.implementation("pandas")
def normalize(...):
    ...

@NormalizeCustomers.implementation("sql")
def normalize(...):
    ...
```

Pipelantic chooses the implementation through the active execution profile.

## Execution Profiles

Conceptually:

```python
ExecutionProfile(
    dataframe_engine="polars",
)
```

Changing profiles changes the implementation—not the transformation contract.

## Sync and Async

Both synchronous and asynchronous implementations are supported.

```python
@NormalizeCustomers.implementation("polars")
def normalize(...):
    ...
```

```python
@NormalizeCustomers.implementation("remote")
async def normalize(...):
    ...
```

Pipelantic normalizes invocation internally so authors do not manage event
loops or thread pools directly.

## Signature Validation

Implementations must satisfy their transformation contract.

Pipelantic validates:

- Required inputs
- Required parameters
- Declared outputs
- Parameter types
- Return structure

Planning should fail if an implementation cannot satisfy the declared interface.

## Return Values

Implementations should return values matching the declared outputs.

```python
class ValidateCustomers(Transformation):
    customers: Input[RawCustomer]

    valid: Output[Customer]
    rejected: Output[RejectedCustomer]
```

Conceptually:

```python
return {
    "valid": valid_df,
    "rejected": rejected_df,
}
```

Pipelantic validates the returned outputs before they continue downstream.

## Runtime Independence

Implementations may use:

- Polars
- Pandas
- DuckDB
- SQL
- Spark
- Remote services
- Future plugins

The transformation contract never depends on these libraries.

## Callbacks

Implementations may trigger lifecycle callbacks such as:

- Invalid input
- Invalid output
- Execution failure
- Retry
- Completion

Callbacks remain independent of execution engines.

## Registration

Implementations are registered against a transformation rather than embedded
inside it.

This allows third-party packages to provide optimized implementations without
changing the original transformation contract.

## Discovery

Pipelantic discovers implementations during planning.

Selection considers:

- Execution profile
- Runtime capabilities
- Plugin availability
- Version compatibility

## Best Practices

- Keep contracts execution-agnostic.
- Register one implementation per runtime.
- Reuse business logic where practical.
- Validate outputs before returning them.
- Prefer native capabilities of each runtime.

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid:

- Referencing dataframe types in transformation contracts.
- Embedding runtime logic inside transformation declarations.
- Returning undeclared outputs.
- Using global runtime state.

## Key Principle

> A `Transformation` defines the logical interface. An implementation fulfills
that interface for a specific execution backend.

data, execution failures, retries, and other lifecycle events.
