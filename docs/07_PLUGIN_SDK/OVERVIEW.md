# Plugin SDK Overview

The PipelineModel Plugin SDK defines the public interfaces used to extend
PipelineModel without modifying its core.

The core framework is responsible for modeling, validation, planning, and
contract management. Plugins provide concrete runtime behavior for execution,
storage, orchestration, resources, registries, and other extension points.

## Purpose

The Plugin SDK exists to:

- Keep the core framework small and stable.
- Enable independent plugin development.
- Support multiple execution technologies.
- Preserve portable pipeline semantics.
- Encourage a healthy ecosystem of community plugins.

Every plugin consumes or contributes to the execution of a validated
`PipelinePlan`. No plugin changes the meaning of the pipeline.

## Core Principles

The SDK is built around a few simple principles:

- **Stable interfaces** — Public APIs evolve carefully.
- **Capability driven** — Plugins declare what they support.
- **Portable semantics** — Plugins preserve ODCS, DTCS, and DPCS semantics.
- **Independent versioning** — Plugins evolve independently of the core.
- **Loose coupling** — Plugins depend on the SDK, not each other.

## Plugin Lifecycle

Every plugin follows the same high-level lifecycle:

1. Discovery
2. Registration
3. Capability declaration
4. Validation
5. Planning participation
6. Runtime execution or service provision
7. Diagnostics
8. Cleanup

## Plugin Categories

PipelineModel currently defines several plugin categories:

- Execution Plugins
- Dataframe Plugins
- Orchestration Plugins
- Storage Plugins
- Resource Plugins
- Registry Plugins

Additional categories may be introduced without changing the architecture.

## Capability Matching

Planning selects plugins based on declared capabilities.

Examples include:

- Async execution
- Parallel execution
- Streaming
- Retry support
- Transactions
- Checkpoints
- Approval workflows

If a plugin cannot satisfy mandatory requirements, planning fails before
execution.

## Version Compatibility

Plugins should publish compatibility information for:

- PipelineModel
- ODCS
- DTCS
- DPCS

This allows the ecosystem to evolve while maintaining predictable behavior.

## Best Practices

- Build plugins against the public SDK only.
- Keep implementations focused on one responsibility.
- Preserve observable pipeline behavior.
- Emit structured diagnostics.
- Document capabilities clearly.

## Key Principle

> PipelineModel provides the portable execution model. The Plugin SDK enables
> implementations to extend that model while preserving its semantics and
> interoperability.
