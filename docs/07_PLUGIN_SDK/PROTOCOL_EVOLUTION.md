# Protocol Evolution Policy

> **Status: Ships with ETLantic 0.22 RC.** Protocol `/1` families are
> **freeze-eligible**, not frozen, until external feedback cycles and the
> exit-gate checklist in
> [EXIT_GATE_0_22](../11_DEVELOPMENT/EXIT_GATE_0_22.md) are satisfied.

This document is the normative policy for evolving ETLantic plugin protocols
(`etlantic.dataframe/1`, `etlantic.sql/1`, `etlantic.spark/1`,
`etlantic.orchestration/1`, `etlantic.transform-compiler/1`,
`etlantic.scheduler/1`, and related wire schemas). It complements
[Capability Vocabulary](CAPABILITY_VOCABULARY.md),
[Testing Plugins](TESTING_PLUGINS.md),
[Building a Plugin](BUILDING_A_PLUGIN.md), and
[Distribution](DISTRIBUTION.md).

## Goals

- Let third-party plugins implement against public protocols without depending
  on first-party engine identity.
- Make optional behaviour negotiable and inspectable.
- Separate **protocol compatibility** from **production trust**.
- Freeze `/1` only after external proof, not merely because a core minor ships.

## Protocol identifiers

Protocol ids use the form `etlantic.<family>/<major>` (for example
`etlantic.dataframe/1`). The major component is the compatibility boundary:

| Change | Allowed within `/1`? | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Add optional method / capability | Yes | Advertise; negotiate |
| Tighten required behaviour of an existing method | No | New major (`/2`) |
| Remove or rename a required method | No | New major |
| Expand capability vocabulary with implications | Yes (vocab major) | See vocabulary policy |
| Change wire schema meaning incompatibly | No | New schema id |

Capability vocabulary versions (`etlantic.capabilities/1`) evolve
**independently** of protocol majors. See
[Capability Vocabulary](CAPABILITY_VOCABULARY.md).

## Optional-method negotiation

Protocols may expose optional methods or capability-gated behaviours.

Rules:

1. **Advertise before relying.** Plugins must declare the matching capability
   (or protocol method) in `PluginCapabilities` / manifest entries before the
   planner or runtime may select that path.
2. **Fail closed on missing optionals.** Callers must not assume an optional
   method exists. Use capability checks or `getattr`/`hasattr` negotiation;
   never call an undeclared optional and swallow `AttributeError` as success.
3. **Overstated claims fail conformance.** Public suites in `etlantic.testing`
   assert claim consistency and, where probed, behaviour truthfulness. See
   [Testing Plugins](TESTING_PLUGINS.md).
4. **Required methods stay required.** Making a required method optional, or
   optional required, is a new protocol major.

## Support windows vs package pins

While ETLantic is pre-1.0:

- **Core minor pin:** plugin packages should declare
  `etlantic>=X.Y,<X.(Y+1)` (for 0.22: `etlantic>=0.22,<0.23`).
- **Protocol major:** a plugin that implements `etlantic.dataframe/1` remains
  protocol-compatible across core minors that still speak `/1`, subject to the
  package pin above.
- **Support window:** first-party plugins match the core minor. Third-party
  plugins own their support window; ETLantic documents which protocol majors
  the current core speaks, not a multi-year LTS for every third-party wheel.
- **Deprecation:** demotions and renames ship with migration notes and
  warn-once compatibility aliases before removal.

Use `etlantic plugin compatibility` to evaluate an installed plugin's
manifest and packaging metadata against the running core (protocol ranges,
capability vocabulary, plan schema, Requires-Python, core pin, allowlist).

## Compatibility ≠ production trust

Passing protocol negotiation or `etlantic plugin compatibility` means the
plugin **speaks the right dialects**. It does **not** grant production trust.

Production trust still requires:

- Non-empty `Profile.plugin_allowlist` (fail closed) for production profiles
- Authorize-before-load plugin lifecycle / manifests
- `SafeIoPolicy` and related IO / outbound controls
- Secret-free plans, reports, and diagnostics
- Conformance suites for advertised capabilities

A compatible but non-allowlisted plugin must not load in production. An
allowlisted plugin that overstates capabilities must still fail conformance.

## Manifests and discovery

Plugins ship `etlantic-plugin-manifest.json` (schema
`etlantic.plugin_manifest/1`) with:

- `protocol_range` — opaque ids and/or version-like ranges the package supports
- `entries[].protocol` — per entry-point protocol id
- `capabilities` — coarse package-level capability tags

Discovery authorizes manifests before importing entry points. See
[Distribution](DISTRIBUTION.md) and [Building a Plugin](BUILDING_A_PLUGIN.md).

## Freeze eligibility for `/1`

ETLantic **0.22 is a Plugin SDK Release Candidate**. Protocol `/1` families are
**not declared frozen** in 0.22.0 itself.

`/1` becomes freeze-eligible when all of the following hold:

1. First-party plugins exercise **only** public `etlantic.testing` suites in CI
2. At least one out-of-monorepo reference plugin
   (`etlantic-plugin-echo` or equivalent) is green against published/workspace
   core via public suites + `etlantic plugin compatibility`
3. External feedback cycles documented in
   [EXIT_GATE_0_22](../11_DEVELOPMENT/EXIT_GATE_0_22.md) are complete
   (default: freeze after **N ≥ 1** external feedback cycles post-RC)
4. No unresolved architectural dependency on first-party engine identity sets

Until freeze, additive optional methods and vocabulary clarifications may land
in core minors that still speak `/1`. Incompatible changes require `/2`.
