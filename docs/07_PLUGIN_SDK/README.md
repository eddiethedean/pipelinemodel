# Plugin SDK

The Plugin SDK enables developers to extend Pipelantic with new execution
engines, dataframe backends, storage providers, resource providers,
orchestration platforms, registries, and future extension points.

Pipelantic is intentionally designed around a small, stable core and a rich
plugin ecosystem. The SDK defines the public interfaces, lifecycle, and
conformance requirements for building those plugins.

## What This Section Covers

This section explains how to:

- Build plugins
- Register plugins
- Declare capabilities
- Implement execution interfaces
- Extend Pipelantic safely
- Test plugins
- Version plugins
- Publish plugins
- Maintain compatibility

## Philosophy

Pipelantic defines the portable modeling layer.

Plugins provide implementation-specific behavior.

```

The SDK allows the ecosystem to grow without expanding the responsibilities of
the core library.

## Design Goals

The Plugin SDK should:

- Keep the core framework small.
- Provide stable extension interfaces.
- Preserve Pipelantic semantics.
- Support independent plugin releases.
- Encourage interoperability.
- Enable community-developed plugins.

## Plugin Lifecycle

Typical lifecycle:

1. Discover
2. Register
3. Validate
4. Advertise capabilities
5. Participate in planning
6. Execute or provide services
7. Report diagnostics
8. Clean up resources

## Plugin Categories

The SDK supports plugin categories such as:

- Execution plugins
- Dataframe plugins
- Orchestration plugins
- Storage plugins
- Resource providers
- Registry plugins
- Observability providers
- Future extension types

Each category has its own specialized interface while sharing common lifecycle
and capability concepts.

## Capability-Driven Architecture

Plugins explicitly advertise the features they support.

Planning uses these capabilities to determine whether a plugin can satisfy a
Pipeline Plan without changing its semantics.

## Versioning

Plugins should declare compatibility with:

- Pipelantic
- ODCS
- DTCS
- DPCS

Independent versioning allows plugins to evolve without forcing synchronized
releases across the ecosystem.

## Documentation Roadmap

Read this section in the following order:

1. [Overview](OVERVIEW.md)
2. [Dataframe Plugin](DATAFRAME_PLUGIN.md)
3. [Orchestrator Plugin](ORCHESTRATOR_PLUGIN.md)
4. [Storage Plugin](STORAGE_PLUGIN.md)
5. [Resource Provider](RESOURCE_PROVIDER.md)
6. [Observability Provider](OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER.md)
7. [SQL Plugin](SQL_PLUGIN.md)
8. [PySpark Plugin](PYSPARK_PLUGIN.md)
9. [Testing Plugins](TESTING_PLUGINS.md)
10. [Distribution](DISTRIBUTION.md)

## Key Principles

- The core owns modeling.
- Plugins own implementation.
- Capability matching drives planning.
- Plugins preserve, not redefine, pipeline semantics.
- Stable SDK interfaces encourage a healthy ecosystem.
- Plugin discovery is a trust decision because Python plugins execute code.
- Production profiles should support allowlists and pinned plugin versions.

Plugin authors should read the
[Security Model](../02_FOUNDATIONS/SECURITY.md).
