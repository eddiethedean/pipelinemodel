# Testing Plugins

> **Status: Available in ETLantic 0.21.0** via `etlantic.testing`.

Testing helpers provide conformance suites so third-party plugins can prove
they implement the public protocols correctly.

## Shipped suites

| Suite | Module | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| Dataframe conformance | `etlantic.testing.run_conformance_suite` | Polars/Pandas-style plugins |
| SQL conformance | `etlantic.testing.run_sql_conformance_suite` | `SqlPlugin` |
| Spark conformance | `etlantic.testing.run_spark_conformance_suite` | `SparkPlugin` (session-free compile + capability truthfulness) |
| Orchestrator conformance | `etlantic.testing.run_orchestrator_conformance_suite` | `OrchestratorPlugin` |
| Scheduler conformance | `etlantic.testing.run_scheduler_conformance_suite` | `ExecutionScheduler` |
| Secret conformance | `etlantic.testing.run_secret_conformance_suite` | `SecretProvider` |
| Write-semantics parity | `etlantic.testing.run_write_semantics_parity_suite` | Cross-engine write modes |
| Portable transform compiler | `etlantic.testing.run_portable_transform_conformance_suite` | `TransformCompiler` plugins |
| Tabular interchange smoke (Gate A) | `etlantic.testing.run_tabular_interchange_conformance_smoke` | Producer/consumer `PluginCapabilities` for `etlantic.interchange/1` |

### Capability truthfulness

All suites assert that advertised capabilities are internally consistent with
the versioned capability vocabulary (`etlantic.capabilities/1`): a claim that
implies a family root (for example `sql_merge` ⇒ `sql`, `spark_merge` ⇒ `spark`)
fails closed when the root is missing, and an unknown vocabulary major is
rejected. Use the shared helpers directly to probe behaviour against claims:

```python
from etlantic.testing import (
    assert_capability_claims_consistent,
    assert_capability_matches_behavior,
)

assert_capability_claims_consistent(plugin.info.capabilities)
assert_capability_matches_behavior(
    plugin.info.capabilities, "lazy", probe=lambda: has_lazy_frames()
)
```

Overstated capabilities raise `AssertionError` with an actionable, secret-free
finding. Suites are **capability-driven**: no engine name is special-cased, so a
third-party engine name behaves identically to a first-party one.

Example:

```python
from etlantic.testing import run_conformance_suite

run_conformance_suite(my_plugin, engine="my-engine", sample_rows=rows)
```

```python
from etlantic.testing import run_portable_transform_conformance_suite
from my_engine import create_transform_compiler

run_portable_transform_conformance_suite(create_transform_compiler())
```

```python
from etlantic.testing import run_tabular_interchange_conformance_smoke

descriptor = run_tabular_interchange_conformance_smoke(producer_caps, consumer_caps)
assert descriptor.schema == "etlantic.interchange/1"
```

The portable suite is also importable as
`etlantic.testing.portable_transform_conformance`. It selects mandatory
fixtures from the exact profiles, actions, and functions a compiler
advertises. Claiming a capability without its fixture family fails the suite.

## Philosophy

Every plugin should be tested against the same expectations:

```text
Plugin
   │
   ▼
SDK Conformance Suite
   │
   ├── Discovery / registration
   ├── Capability advertisement
   ├── Semantic behavior
   └── Failure / diagnostic shape
```

A plugin that passes the matching suite should behave predictably with
ETLantic planning and runtime.

## Compatibility policy

- Claim only capabilities your compiler passes in the public suite.
- Pin `etlantic` (and this suite) to the minor you certified against (`==0.21.0`).
- Fail closed at `analyze()` for unsupported modes; do not degrade silently.
- Keep plans, explain payloads, and diagnostics secret-free.
