# Portable Transformation Compiler Protocol

!!! warning "Proposed for ETLantic 0.12 — not importable in 0.11"
    This page defines the intended `etlantic.transform-compiler/1` boundary for
    consuming DTCS Transformation Plans. It is not a currently importable SDK.
    0.12 ships planning plus a Polars **kernel** compiler; relational and
    multi-engine claims follow in 0.13+.

A portable transformation compiler translates a validated
`dtcs.transform-plan/2` (and readable v1) into backend-native expressions without changing its
DTCS-defined meaning.

## Boundary

```text
DTCS TransformationPlan
      │
      ├── support analysis (pure)
      ├── compilation (no data access)
      ▼
CompiledTransform
      │
      └── execution with runtime inputs and parameters
```

Support analysis and compilation belong to planning. Execution belongs to the
runtime. A serialized `PipelinePlan` contains IR, requirements, compiler
identity, and fingerprints—not live compiled objects or closures.

## Proposed protocol

```python
@runtime_checkable
class PortableTransformCompiler(Protocol):
    @property
    def info(self) -> TransformCompilerInfo: ...

    def analyze(
        self,
        definition: TransformationPlan,
        *,
        context: TransformPlanningContext,
    ) -> TransformSupportReport: ...

    def compile(
        self,
        definition: TransformationPlan,
        *,
        context: TransformCompileContext,
    ) -> CompiledTransform: ...

    async def execute(
        self,
        compiled: CompiledTransform,
        *,
        inputs: Mapping[str, Any],
        parameters: Mapping[str, Any],
        context: TransformExecutionContext,
    ) -> TransformOutputBundle: ...
```

Plugins MAY separate compilation and execution into cooperating objects. SQL
and orchestration plugins MAY compile artifacts for execution outside the local
process.

## Compiler information

```python
TransformCompilerInfo(
    name="etlantic-polars",
    version="...",
    engine="polars",
    compiler_protocol="etlantic.transform-compiler/1",
    dtcs_plan_versions=("dtcs.transform-plan/2", "dtcs.transform-plan/1"),
    capabilities=TransformCapabilities(...),
)
```

Capabilities are an ETLantic adapter over the DTCS Engine Capability Model.
They list exact registered Semantic Action/Function versions, portable types,
semantic modes, maximum supported plan size, lazy/eager behavior, and artifact
ownership. Plans and reports preserve the originating DTCS capability
identifiers.

The compiler reports support against the published profiles, never a vague
"PySpark compatible" flag:

| DTCS profile | Compiler claim |
|---|---|
| `dtcs:profile/portable-relational-kernel/1` | all required kernel actions, expressions, operators, and functions |
| `dtcs:profile/portable-relational/1` | full relational joins, unions, grouping, aggregation, ordering, deduplication, and limits |
| `dtcs:profile/portable-window/1` | experimental windows, functions, and row/range frames |
| `dtcs:profile/portable-complex-types/1` | experimental composite types and access operations |

A compiler may advertise a subset as individual capabilities. It may advertise
a profile only when every requirement and DTCS conformance fixture in that
profile passes.

### Initial Polars claim matrix (0.12)

`etlantic-polars` **must** claim and privately fixture:

| Item | 0.12 requirement |
|---|---|
| Profile | `dtcs:profile/portable-relational-kernel/1` |
| Plan shape | Accept `dtcs.transform-plan/2` (and readable v1); `/2` metadata compatibility without extra relational ops |
| Actions / ops | Kernel surface covered by golden fixtures such as `tests/fixtures/portable/kernel_normalize.json` (project, filter, with_fields, rename/drop, scalar expressions) |
| Outside claim set | Fail closed in `analyze()` / planning (`PMXFORM3xx`) |

`etlantic-polars` **must not** claim in 0.12:
`portable-relational/1`, Rich Portable Analytics families, windows, or
complex-value profiles. Those compiler claims belong to 0.13–0.15.

## Support reports

`analyze()` is deterministic and side-effect free. It returns one finding per
unsupported or conditional requirement:

```python
TransformSupportReport(
    supported=False,
    findings=(
        TransformSupportFinding(
            code="PMXFORM301",
            expression_path="outputs.result.project.full_name",
            requirement="function:dtcs:concat_ws",
            reason="function is not implemented",
        ),
    ),
)
```

It MUST NOT import arbitrary user modules, resolve secrets, acquire resources,
read data, or contact a backend. Optional backend capability probing is a
separate explicitly requested operation and cannot weaken fail-closed planning.

Analysis MUST cover each required profile, Semantic Action, Function,
Operator, logical type, action mode, value-state behavior, ordering guarantee,
and resource limit. A backend that supports `join` but not, for example,
`nullSafe`, `semi`, or collision policy handling reports the exact unsupported
mode rather than claiming generic join support.

## Compiled transform

A compiled transform contains:

- compiler and engine identity
- source IR fingerprint
- logical output mapping
- required runtime parameter names
- materialization and ownership requirements
- backend-native plan held only in runtime memory or a safe generated artifact
- explain metadata without secrets or row data

Compilation MUST be deterministic for equivalent IR, compiler version, and
compile context. Backend-native objects MUST NOT be serialized into the
portable `PipelinePlan`.

## Execution output

Execution normalizes results into:

```python
TransformOutputBundle(
    valid={"result": value},
    invalid={},
    side={},
    diagnostics=[],
    metrics=TransformMetrics(...),
)
```

The existing dataframe output bundle may be generalized or adapted rather than
duplicated. Output port roles and logical identities must survive compilation.

## Compiler responsibilities

A compiler MUST:

- preserve normative portable semantics
- reject unsupported operations before execution
- validate identifiers and bind values safely
- retain logical expression and output mappings
- preserve validation and security-domain boundaries
- expose collection, copy, and materialization requirements
- emit structured, redacted diagnostics
- enforce advertised limits

A compiler MUST NOT:

- silently approximate an operation
- inject UDFs or raw SQL as a fallback
- collect lazy values during planning or compilation
- embed secret values in compiled or explained artifacts
- optimize across security, validation, retry, or materialization boundaries
- report capabilities it does not pass in conformance tests

## Backend expectations

### Polars

Compile to `pl.Expr` and `LazyFrame` operations. Preserve laziness until the
plan declares collection. Avoid row conversion between compatible Polars
steps.

### Pandas

Compile to dataframe and series operations. Declare eager execution, copying,
index treatment, and unsupported operations precisely. Portable semantics must
not depend on a meaningful Pandas index.

### SQL

Lower into the safe ETLantic SQL IR before dialect compilation. Use bound
parameters, validate identifiers, retain relation lineage, and prohibit trusted
SQL fragments in portable definitions.

### PySpark

Compile to native DataFrame and Column expressions. Preserve Catalyst-visible
operations. Python and Pandas UDF fallback is forbidden unless a future,
explicitly non-portable capability is selected.

## Discovery

The proposed entry-point group is:

```toml
[project.entry-points."etlantic.transform_compilers"]
polars = "etlantic_polars:create_transform_compiler"
```

An existing engine plugin MAY expose its compiler through its primary plugin
object. Discovery must still produce an explicit compiler descriptor so plans
can record protocol and capability compatibility.

Production profiles require plugin allowlisting and version policy. Compiler
discovery is a trust decision because Python entry points execute with host
process privileges.

## Conformance

**0.12** uses private Polars kernel fixtures under `packages/etlantic-polars`
and core tests. The **public** suite lands in **0.14**:

```python
from etlantic.testing import portable_transform_conformance
```

Required fixture families (public suite):

- capability accuracy
- deterministic compilation
- scalar and relational semantics
- nulls, NaN, overflow, decimal, and casts
- timestamps and ordering
- joins and aggregations
- multiple output roles
- lazy/eager and ownership behavior
- unsupported-operation diagnostics
- bounded hostile IR
- secret and parameter redaction
- cross-engine result equivalence

Fixtures are grouped by the published DTCS profiles. A plugin claiming the
kernel or relational profile runs the entire corresponding family. Window and
complex-types fixtures remain experimental and require two independent
conforming compilers before their DTCS profiles can graduate from experimental
status.

Advertised capability coverage, not plugin name, determines which fixtures are
mandatory.

## Versioning

Compiler packages declare compatible core, plan-schema, and transform-protocol
versions. Unknown IR major versions fail closed. Capability additions may be
minor releases; changing an existing operation's meaning requires a new IR
major version.
