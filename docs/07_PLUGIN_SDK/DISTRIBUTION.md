# Distribution

Distribution describes how ETLantic plugins are packaged, published,
discovered, installed, and maintained across the ecosystem.

A healthy plugin ecosystem depends on stable distribution practices. Plugins
should be independently releasable while remaining compatible with the
ETLantic Plugin SDK and supported standards.

## Goals

Plugin distribution should:

- Support independent releases.
- Encourage semantic versioning.
- Make installation simple.
- Preserve compatibility metadata.
- Enable automated discovery.
- Support community and commercial plugins.

## Philosophy

The ETLantic core should remain small.

Functionality grows through independently distributed plugins.

```

## Packaging

Plugins should be distributed as standard Python packages.

Recommended naming convention:

- etlantic-airflow
- etlantic-polars
- etlantic-pandas
- etlantic-postgres
- etlantic-s3
- etlantic-keyring
- etlantic-secrets-aws
- etlantic-secrets-azure
- etlantic-secrets-gcp
- etlantic-secrets-vault

Third-party plugins should follow a consistent naming convention where practical.

## Installation

Typical installation:

```bash
pip install etlantic-airflow
```

Multiple plugins may be installed simultaneously.

Profiles determine which plugins are used.

## Discovery

Installed plugins are discoverable through domain-specific helpers (no global
registry class):

```python
from etlantic.dataframe import discover_dataframe_plugins
from etlantic.orchestration import discover_orchestrator_plugins
from etlantic.spark import discover_spark_plugins, discover_spark_providers
from etlantic.sql import discover_sql_plugins

dataframe_plugins = discover_dataframe_plugins()
sql_plugins = discover_sql_plugins()
spark_plugins = discover_spark_plugins()
spark_providers = discover_spark_providers()
orchestrators = discover_orchestrator_plugins()
```

CLI: `etlantic plugin list`. Discovery does not require manual registration in
normal deployments. Secret providers are attached to the runtime / profile.

## Compatibility Metadata

Every plugin should publish:

- Plugin name
- Plugin version
- Supported ETLantic version(s)
- Supported SDK version
- Supported ODCS version(s)
- Supported DTCS version(s)
- Supported DPCS version(s)
- Capability declarations

Planning uses this metadata when selecting plugins.

## Semantic Versioning

Plugins should follow Semantic Versioning.

- MAJOR — breaking SDK or behavior changes
- MINOR — backward-compatible features
- PATCH — bug fixes and non-semantic improvements

## Release Workflow

Recommended workflow:

1. Implement
2. Test
3. Run SDK conformance suite
4. Publish package
5. Publish release notes
6. Update compatibility matrix

## Dependency Management

Plugins should minimize dependencies and isolate backend-specific libraries.

Optional dependencies should be preferred where practical to avoid unnecessary
install size for users who do not need every backend.

## Security

Plugin authors should:

- Sign releases when possible.
- Keep dependencies updated.
- Avoid embedding credentials.
- Follow secure disclosure practices.
- Publish supported version ranges.
- Ensure secret-provider packages pass redaction, rotation, lease, and
  sentinel-leak conformance tests.

## Compatibility report

Independently installed plugins can check compatibility without private
modules:

```bash
etlantic plugin compatibility etlantic-polars --format json
etlantic plugin compatibility --format human
```

The report compares the plugin's static `etlantic-plugin-manifest.json` and
packaging metadata against the installed core: protocol ranges, capability
vocabulary (`etlantic.capabilities/1`), plan schema (`etlantic.plan/1`),
Requires-Python, the plugin's `etlantic` pin, and (with `--profile`) allowlist
status. Findings use `PMPLUG44x` codes and fail closed on mismatch.

## Best Practices

- Keep plugins independently releasable.
- Publish clear compatibility metadata.
- Run `etlantic plugin compatibility` in plugin CI against the supported core range.
- Use semantic versioning.
- Ship documentation with every release.
- Maintain changelogs.

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid:

- Bundling all plugins into the core package.
- Publishing plugins without compatibility metadata.
- Introducing breaking changes in minor releases.
- Hiding runtime dependencies.
- Depending on internal ETLantic APIs.

## Key Principle

> ETLantic grows through a distributed ecosystem of independently versioned
> plugins. Stable packaging, discovery, and compatibility metadata allow users
> to compose the execution environment that best fits their pipelines.
