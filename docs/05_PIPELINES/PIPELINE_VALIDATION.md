# Pipeline Validation

ETLantic treats validation as a continuous envelope around ETL:

```text
V(model) ──▶ Extract ──▶ V(input) ──▶ Transform ──▶ V(output) ──▶ Load ──▶ V/evidence
```

Pipeline validation proves the model, wiring, environment, and capabilities
before execution. Runtime data validation then enforces the same typed
boundaries around extracted inputs, transformation inputs and outputs,
interchange transitions, and publication. Post-load validation means truthful
publication evidence or an explicitly planned read-after-write check—not an
implicit sink reread. See
[Validation Everywhere](../02_FOUNDATIONS/VALIDATION_EVERYWHERE.md) for the
complete concept.

For portable steps in 0.11+, validation additionally resolves referenced
columns, infers expression types and nullability, verifies named outputs against
contracts, enforces IR budgets, and checks exact compiler capabilities before
execution.

Pipeline validation ensures that a pipeline is **correct before it executes**.

One of ETLantic's core design goals is to detect modeling mistakes during
authoring and planning rather than allowing them to fail unpredictably at
runtime. Validation is therefore a first-class feature, not an optional step.

## Goals

Pipeline validation should:

- Detect errors as early as possible.
- Produce deterministic, typed diagnostics.
- Remain independent of execution engines.
- Validate logical semantics instead of implementation details.
- Support both code-first and contract-first workflows.
- Enable CI/CD validation before deployment.

## Validation Philosophy

ETLantic validates a pipeline in layers.

```text

       ▼
Definition Validation
       │
       ▼
Graph Validation
       │
       ▼
Contract Validation

       ▼
Semantic Validation
       │
       ▼
Capability Validation
       │
       ▼
Pipeline Plan
```

Each stage builds on the previous one.

## Validation Phases

### 1. Definition Validation

Checks the Python model itself.

Examples:

- Duplicate names
- Invalid type annotations
- Missing required metadata
- Invalid source, sink, or step declarations
- Invalid subpipeline declarations

### 2. Graph Validation

Ensures the logical graph is well formed.

Checks include:

- No prohibited cycles
- Valid dependencies
- Reachable nodes
- Connected inputs
- Connected outputs
- No duplicate edges
- Valid source and sink placement

### 3. Contract Validation

Verifies referenced contracts.

Examples:

- ODCS data contracts exist
- DTCS transformation contracts exist
- DPCS subpipelines resolve
- Version requirements
- Compatibility rules

### 4. Semantic Validation

Validates pipeline meaning.

Examples:

- Scheduling intent
- Failure semantics
- Quality gates
- Public interfaces
- Execution requirements
- Extension integrity

### 5. Capability Validation

Compares pipeline requirements against the selected execution profile.

Examples:

- Retry support
- Parallel execution
- Streaming
- Checkpoints
- Compensation
- Approval workflows

Mandatory unsupported capabilities should prevent execution.

## Validation Scope

ETLantic validates:

- Pipeline metadata
- Sources
- Steps
- Sinks
- Subpipelines
- Inputs
- Outputs
- Parameters
- Data contracts
- Transformation contracts
- Pipeline contracts
- References
- Graph topology
- Lineage
- Extensions

## Incremental Validation

Editors and IDE integrations should validate incrementally as developers modify
their pipelines.

This enables immediate feedback without rebuilding the entire `PipelinePlan`.

## Diagnostics

Validation should return structured diagnostics instead of only raising
exceptions.

A diagnostic may include:

- Stable code
- Severity
- Validation phase
- Pipeline identity
- Step identity
- Source location
- Human-readable message
- Suggested remediation

Example:

```text
PMVAL104

Pipeline: CustomerPipeline
Step: publish_customers
Phase: Graph Validation

Required input "customers" is not connected.
```

## Validation API

Conceptually:

```python
result = CustomerPipeline.validate()

if result.valid:
    print("Pipeline is valid.")
else:
    for diagnostic in result.diagnostics:
        print(diagnostic)
```

Validation should never require execution.

## Planning Relationship

Validation precedes planning.

```text
Pipeline
   │
   ▼
Validation
   │
   ▼
Pipeline Plan
   │
   ▼
Execution
```

An invalid pipeline must not produce a Pipeline Plan.

## CI/CD

Recommended validation workflow:

- Validate every commit.
- Validate before artifact generation.
- Validate before publishing DPCS.
- Validate before deployment.
- Fail builds on validation errors.

## Best Practices

- Validate early and often.
- Treat warnings and errors differently.
- Keep diagnostics deterministic.
- Validate contracts before binding.
- Validate against execution capabilities before deployment.

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid:

- Delaying validation until runtime.
- Depending on orchestrator-specific validators.
- Ignoring compatibility warnings.
- Silently skipping unsupported requirements.
- Returning unstructured validation errors.

## Key Principle

> Validation proves that a pipeline is logically correct. Execution proves that
> the surrounding environment can successfully run it.

## Next Step

Continue with [Planning](PLANNING.md) to learn how a validated pipeline is
resolved into an execution-independent `PipelinePlan`.
