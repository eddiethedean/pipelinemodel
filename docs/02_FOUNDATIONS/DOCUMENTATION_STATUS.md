# Documentation Status and Conventions

Pipelantic is currently a design-first, pre-implementation project. The
documentation serves three related purposes:

1. Explain the product vision and user experience.
2. Specify the intended 1.0 architecture and public interfaces.
3. Provide implementation guidance and acceptance criteria.

## Stability Labels

Documents use these conceptual stability levels:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Foundational | A project boundary or principle expected to remain stable |
| Accepted design | A chosen API or architecture direction pending implementation |
| Proposed | A concrete surface that may change as implementation pressure appears |
| Normative | A requirement defined by a contract specification |
| Example | Illustrative code that expresses intended UX |

Unless a chapter says otherwise, user-guide code should be read as an
**accepted design example**, not as evidence of a published package API.

## Normative Authority

The source of truth depends on the subject:

| Subject | Authority |
|---|---|
| Data-contract meaning | Upstream ODCS specification |
| Transformation-contract meaning | `DTCS_SPEC.md` |
| Pipeline-contract meaning | `DPCS_SPEC.md` |
| ContractModel behavior | ContractModel project |
| Pipelantic architecture and API | This documentation until code and tests supersede it |
| Backend behavior | Plugin documentation and conformance tests |

Integration guides explain how Pipelantic uses a standard; they do not
replace normative specifications.

## Requirement Language

The DTCS and DPCS specifications use normative requirement terms such as
`MUST`, `SHOULD`, and `MAY`.

User guides generally use plain explanatory language. Reference and development
documents may use `should` to describe intended 1.0 behavior, but those
statements are not contract-standard requirements unless linked to a normative
specification.

## Code Examples

Examples prioritize a coherent authoring model:

```python
class NormalizeCustomers(Transformation):
    customers: Input[RawCustomer]
    result: Output[Customer]
```

As implementation begins:

- Examples should become executable or syntax-checked.
- Unsupported examples should be marked explicitly.
- Renamed APIs should be updated across the whole documentation set.
- Generated artifacts should be checked in CI.

## Design Versus Runtime

Documentation must preserve this distinction:

```text
Pipeline / Transformation / Contract
Portable meaning

PipelinePlan
Resolved execution-independent plan

Plugin or compiled artifact
Backend realization

Run result and events
Observed execution
```

Avoid using these layers interchangeably.

## Adding or Changing Documentation

When changing a central concept:

1. Update the glossary.
2. Update the relevant design decision.
3. Update architecture and lifecycle diagrams.
4. Update authoring examples.
5. Update reference APIs.
6. Update plugin conformance expectations.
7. Run internal-link and code-fence checks.

## Current Implementation Boundary

The roadmap, not chapter volume, determines implementation status. A detailed
chapter may describe a future backend or SDK surface that has not yet been
built.
