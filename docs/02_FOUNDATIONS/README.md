## Foundation in One Sentence

> Pipelantic uses typed Python declarations and three portable contract
> standards to build a validated logical pipeline, resolves that pipeline into
> a deterministic `PipelinePlan`, and delegates realization to external
> backends through plugins.

## Non-Negotiable Boundaries

- ODCS, DTCS, and DPCS own contract semantics.
- ContractModel operationalizes data contracts.
- Pipelantic owns typed authoring, validation, planning, and coordination.
- Plugins own backend adaptation.
- External systems perform computation, scheduling, and persistence.
