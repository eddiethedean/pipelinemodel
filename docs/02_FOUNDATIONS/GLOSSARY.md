# Glossary

This glossary defines the core terminology used throughout the
PipelineModel documentation. Unless otherwise noted, these definitions
reflect PipelineModel's architecture and may differ from how similar
terms are used in other ETL frameworks.

## Artifact

A generated output derived from a pipeline model, such as an ODCS, DTCS,
or DPCS document, documentation, diagrams, or an execution plan.

## Binding

A configuration that connects a logical pipeline component to a concrete
runtime implementation, such as a Polars transformation, an Airflow
orchestrator, or a storage provider.

## Callback

A user-defined function invoked in response to a lifecycle event, such
as invalid data, execution failure, or pipeline completion.

## Contract

A portable, declarative description of part of a data pipeline.
PipelineModel recognizes three primary contract types:

-   Data Contract
-   Transformation Contract
-   Pipeline Contract

## ContractModel

The companion library responsible for operationalizing data contracts.
It provides the `DataContractModel` base class used to define typed
datasets.

## DPCS

**Data Pipeline Contract Standard.**

A portable specification describing the logical topology of a pipeline:
sources, transformations, sinks, and their relationships.

## DTCS

**Data Transformation Contract Standard.**

A portable specification describing the interface of a transformation,
including its inputs, outputs, parameters, and metadata.

## Data Contract

A typed description of a dataset. In PipelineModel, data contracts are
authored as ContractModel-compatible Pydantic models and can be
represented as ODCS documents.

## Data Contract Model

A Python class derived from `DataContractModel` that serves as the
source of truth for a dataset's schema and constraints.

## Execution Engine

The technology that performs actual work, such as Polars, Pandas, Spark,
or a remote processing service.

## Execution Plan

A resolved representation of a logical pipeline that identifies
dependencies, runtime bindings, and the order of execution. An execution
plan is produced by PipelineModel but executed by plugins.

## Hook

A specialized callback associated with a pipeline lifecycle event.

## Input

A typed input port declared by a transformation using `Input[T]`.

## Intermediate Representation (IR)

The internal logical graph created by PipelineModel after type
introspection and validation. The IR is the basis for planning,
visualization, and compilation.

## Node

A logical element within a pipeline graph, such as a source,
transformation step, or sink.

## ODCS

**Open Data Contract Standard.**

The open specification used to represent data contracts.

## Output

A typed output port declared by a transformation using `Output[T]`.

## Parameter

A typed configuration value declared by a transformation using
`Parameter[T]`. Parameters influence transformation behavior without
becoming part of the pipeline graph.

## Pipeline

A logical description of how transformations and data contracts are
connected. A pipeline models intent rather than execution.

## PipelineModel

The framework described by this documentation. PipelineModel models,
validates, documents, and plans pipelines while delegating execution to
external plugins.

## Plugin

An extension that provides runtime functionality not implemented by the
PipelineModel core, such as dataframe processing, orchestration,
storage, or compilation.

## Profile

A named runtime configuration that selects bindings, resources, and
execution settings for a pipeline without changing its logical
definition.

## Resource

An external dependency provided at runtime, such as a database
connection, object storage client, or API client.

## Sink

A pipeline node that receives data produced by upstream transformations
and writes or publishes it through an execution plugin.

## Source

A pipeline node that introduces data into a pipeline from an external
system.

## Step

An instantiated transformation within a pipeline graph.

## Transformation

A typed, declarative description of a data operation. A transformation
specifies inputs, outputs, and parameters, but not a particular
execution technology.

## Validation

The process of verifying contracts, pipeline wiring, parameters, and
implementation compatibility before execution.

## Visualization

A generated representation of a pipeline, such as Mermaid, Graphviz,
HTML, or lineage diagrams, derived from the logical model.

## Summary

PipelineModel intentionally distinguishes between:

-   **Modeling** --- describing pipelines with typed Python classes.
-   **Planning** --- validating and preparing those models for
    execution.
-   **Execution** --- performing work through interchangeable plugins.

Keeping these concepts separate is fundamental to the architecture and
developer experience of PipelineModel.
