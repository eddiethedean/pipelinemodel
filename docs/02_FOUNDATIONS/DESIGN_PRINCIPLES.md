# Design Principles

Portable transformation design follows the same boundary: ETLantic owns a
closed DTCS-aligned semantic IR, while plugins compile it to backend-native
operations. Familiar PySpark-style syntax does not make Spark the semantic
authority, and unsupported behavior fails closed instead of being approximated.

These principles guide every architectural and API decision in
ETLantic. They are intended to keep the framework focused,
predictable, and consistent as it evolves.

## 1. Types Are the Source of Truth

Python type annotations define pipeline interfaces.

From those types, ETLantic should infer contracts, validation
rules, documentation, and editor tooling whenever possible.

Developers should not have to describe the same interface multiple
times.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Model Before You Execute

ETLantic models **what** a pipeline is.

Execution engines determine **how** that pipeline runs.

Modeling concerns belong in ETLantic.

Execution concerns belong in plugins.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Separate Logic from Runtime

Business logic should not depend on a specific dataframe library,
scheduler, or cloud provider.

The same logical pipeline should be able to execute through different
runtime profiles without changing its contract definitions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Prefer Code-First Authoring

Python classes are the preferred authoring experience.

Portable contract documents are generated from those classes whenever
practical.

ETLantic should also support loading existing contracts, but
generated artifacts should remain faithful to the source model.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Embrace Open Standards

ETLantic builds on open specifications rather than proprietary
formats.

-   ODCS for data contracts
-   DTCS for transformation contracts
-   DPCS for pipeline contracts

Where an established standard exists, ETLantic should integrate
with it rather than reinvent it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Minimize Boilerplate

Never ask users to repeat information that can be inferred safely.

Examples include:

-   deriving contracts from type annotations
-   generating diagrams from pipeline topology
-   validating implementations against declared interfaces
-   producing documentation automatically

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Validate Early and at Every Boundary

Errors should be discovered during authoring and planning whenever
possible.

Validation should occur before expensive execution begins.

During execution, the same typed contracts should govern extract,
transformation input/output, engine/interchange, and load boundaries. Required
validation semantics must survive fusion and optimization, and publication
should produce explicit evidence rather than an assumed success.

Clear diagnostics are preferred over runtime surprises.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Keep the Core Small

ETLantic should provide a stable modeling core.

Execution engines, storage systems, orchestration platforms, and
integrations should be implemented as plugins.

A small core is easier to learn, test, and evolve.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Async Without Complexity

ETLantic is asynchronous internally.

Users may write either synchronous (`def`) or asynchronous (`async def`)
implementations.

The framework is responsible for choosing the correct invocation
strategy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Explicit Interfaces

Transformation interfaces should be obvious from their declarations.

``` python
class NormalizeCustomers(Transformation):
    customers: Input[RawCustomer]
    minimum_age: Parameter[int] = 18
    result: Output[Customer]
```

A reader should understand the transformation without reading its
implementation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 11. Portability First

Pipelines should be portable across:

-   execution engines
-   environments
-   organizations
-   deployment targets

Contracts and models should outlive any individual runtime technology.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 12. Optimize for Developer Experience

ETLantic should feel natural to Python developers.

Good defaults, strong typing, meaningful errors, autocomplete, and
generated documentation are not optional---they are part of the
framework's value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 13. Preserve Logical Identity Through Optimization

Backends may fuse, expand, or reorder physical execution units when semantics
permit it.

ETLantic must retain mappings to the original logical sources, steps,
ports, contracts, and sinks so lineage, diagnostics, documentation, and failure
attribution remain understandable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 14. Capabilities Must Be Honest

Plugins must explicitly declare what they support.

ETLantic should fail during planning when a selected backend cannot
preserve required behavior. It must not silently approximate transactions,
streaming guarantees, retries, quality gates, or failure semantics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 15. Plans Are Resolved but Secret-Free

A `PipelinePlan` should contain every reference and capability decision needed
for execution or compilation.

It must not contain resolved credentials, tokens, or secret values. Resource
providers resolve those values at runtime.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 16. Generated Artifacts Are Reproducible

Equivalent validated models and profiles should produce semantically equivalent
contracts, plans, documentation, diagrams, and backend artifacts.

Generation should support a CI check mode so drift is detected automatically.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 17. Prefer Evidence Over Runtime Guessing

Runtime systems should emit structured results, diagnostics, and lineage.

Observed execution evidence may be compared with declared contracts and plans,
but it must not silently mutate the source model.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Decision Filter

When evaluating a new feature, ask:

1.  Does it improve the modeling experience?
2.  Can it be expressed through types or declarative models?
3.  Does it reduce duplication?
4.  Does it preserve runtime independence?
5.  Does it belong in the core rather than a plugin?
6.  Can its semantics be validated before execution?
7.  Does it preserve logical identity and reproducible generation?

If the answer to the last question is "no," the feature should likely be
implemented as a plugin instead.
