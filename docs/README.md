ETLantic is a Python framework for defining typed, contract-driven data
pipelines and coordinating their execution through the tools users already
choose.

Its central idea is simple:

> Define data, transformations, and pipelines with typed Python classes.
> Validate and plan them once. Execute them through interchangeable backends.

ETLantic also treats validation as a continuous envelope around ETL. ETLantic
validates at every typed boundary—before extract, between steps, and at
load—without treating validation as an ordinary transform. See
[Validation Everywhere](02_FOUNDATIONS/VALIDATION_EVERYWHERE.md).

This is the practical meaning of the name: **ETL** is the data flow;
**ETLantic** is ETL surrounded by typed contracts, validation, planning, and
evidence from source to publication.

ETLantic is inspired by FastAPI's type-driven developer experience, but it
does not turn ETL into a web API metaphor. It applies the same principle—types
as executable interface declarations—to data engineering.

## Project status

**ETLantic 0.22.0** is **stable** for documented single-tenant reference
deployments. It models, validates, and plans typed Python data pipelines,
then runs them locally or through optional engine plugins.

- **Use today:** single-tenant reference deployments (see [Capabilities](01_GETTING_STARTED/CAPABILITIES.md)).
- **Not included:** multi-tenant control plane, managed Spark, unrestricted
  enterprise compliance attestations beyond shipped SBOM/attestations
  (adopter-owned for broader compliance programs).
- **Experimental:** Structured Streaming; `etlantic-datafusion` (Gate B stub).

!!! tip "Green path (start here only)"
    1. [Installation](01_GETTING_STARTED/INSTALLATION.md) — `pip install etlantic==0.22.0`
    2. [Quickstart](01_GETTING_STARTED/QUICKSTART.md) — `etlantic init` (five-minute success)
    3. [First Pipeline](01_GETTING_STARTED/FIRST_PIPELINE.md) — evolve the generated project
    4. [Engine selection](01_GETTING_STARTED/ENGINE_SELECTION.md) — then an engine tutorial

    Pages marked **Future design** are not APIs. Design studies under Examples
    are aspirational—not installable APIs.

## Minimal working example

The canonical first success is CLI-first:

```bash
pip install 'etlantic==0.22.0'
mkdir my-pipeline && cd my-pipeline
etlantic init --with-toml
etlantic validate pipeline.py:SamplePipeline --profile development
etlantic plan pipeline.py:SamplePipeline --profile development
etlantic run pipeline.py:SamplePipeline --profile development
cat data/out.json
```

Follow the full [Quickstart](01_GETTING_STARTED/QUICKSTART.md), then
[First Pipeline](01_GETTING_STARTED/FIRST_PIPELINE.md) to evolve the generated
contracts. The PyPI wheel does **not** include `examples/`; from a checkout an
optional in-memory SDK demo is
[`examples/memory_customers.py`](https://github.com/eddiethedean/etlantic/blob/main/examples/memory_customers.py).

From the same typed definitions ETLantic can also generate ODCS / DTCS / DPCS
contracts, Mermaid lineage, and a secret-free `PipelinePlan`. Optional plugins
add Polars, Pandas, SQL, PySpark, and Airflow compilation.

The transformation implementation remains separate—register `"polars"`,
`"sql"`, and other engines the same way after installing the matching plugin.

Runtime execution adds contract checks around extracts, transformation inputs
and outputs, engine/interchange boundaries, and loads. Those checks remain
visible in plan decisions and run evidence even when a backend safely fuses
their physical execution.

ETLantic owns modeling, validation, planning, and coordination.

Standards own contract meaning. ContractModel owns data-contract
operationalization. Plugins and external systems perform the work.

## The Three Contract Authorities

ETLantic intentionally recognizes only three top-level contract families:

| Contract | Authority | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| Data contract | ODCS and ContractModel | What is valid data? |
| Transformation contract | DTCS | How is data expected to change? |
| Pipeline contract | DPCS | How are data and transformations composed? |

Profiles, plugins, resources, callbacks, artifacts, and execution plans are
implementation or runtime concepts—not additional contract standards.

## Non-Goals

ETLantic is not intended to become:

- A dataframe engine
- A distributed scheduler
- A storage system
- A secret manager
- A proprietary pipeline contract format
- A replacement for Pandas, Polars, SQL engines, Spark, Airflow, or Dagster

It is the typed control and interoperability layer that connects those systems
without allowing any one of them to define the pipeline's portable meaning.
