# Pipelantic Documentation

Pipelantic is a proposed Python framework for defining typed,
contract-driven data pipelines and coordinating their execution through the
tools users already choose.

Its central idea is simple:

> Define data, transformations, and pipelines with typed Python classes.
> Validate and plan them once. Execute them through interchangeable backends.

Pipelantic is inspired by FastAPI's type-driven developer experience, but it
does not turn ETL into a web API metaphor. It applies the same principle—types
as executable interface declarations—to data engineering.

## Project Status

Pipelantic is currently **design-first and pre-implementation**. These
documents define the intended product, public API, architecture, Plugin SDK,
and 1.0 direction.

Examples are normative design examples, not a promise that every illustrated
API is already available. Reference chapters explicitly label proposed 1.0
surfaces.

See the [Roadmap](11_DEVELOPMENT/ROADMAP.md) for implementation sequencing.

## Thirty-Second Example

```python
from contractmodel import DataContractModel
from pipelantic import Input, Output, Pipeline, Sink, Source, Transformation


class RawCustomer(DataContractModel):
    customer_id: int
    first_name: str
    last_name: str


class Customer(DataContractModel):
    customer_id: int
    full_name: str


class NormalizeCustomers(Transformation):
    customers: Input[RawCustomer]
    result: Output[Customer]


class CustomerPipeline(Pipeline):
    raw: Source[RawCustomer] = Source(binding="customer_source")
    normalized = NormalizeCustomers.step(customers=raw)
    curated: Sink[Customer] = Sink(
        input=normalized.result,
        binding="customer_sink",
    )
```

From these declarations, Pipelantic can derive:

- ODCS data contracts
- A DTCS transformation contract
- A DPCS pipeline contract
- Static wiring and compatibility diagnostics
- A logical lineage graph
- A resolved `PipelinePlan` for a selected profile
- Documentation and visualizations
- Backend-specific execution artifacts

The transformation implementation remains separate:

```python
@NormalizeCustomers.implementation("polars")
def normalize_customers(customers):
    ...
```

The same transformation may also have Pandas, SQL, PySpark, remote, or other
implementations.

```

Pipelantic owns modeling, validation, planning, and coordination.

Standards own contract meaning. ContractModel owns data-contract
operationalization. Plugins and external systems perform the work.

## The Three Contract Authorities

Pipelantic intentionally recognizes only three top-level contract families:

| Contract | Authority | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| Data contract | ODCS and ContractModel | What is valid data? |
| Transformation contract | DTCS | How is data expected to change? |
| Pipeline contract | DPCS | How are data and transformations composed? |

Profiles, plugins, resources, callbacks, artifacts, and execution plans are
implementation or runtime concepts—not additional contract standards.

## Non-Goals

Pipelantic is not intended to become:

- A dataframe engine
- A distributed scheduler
- A storage system
- A secret manager
- A proprietary pipeline contract format
- A replacement for Pandas, Polars, SQL engines, Spark, Airflow, or Dagster

It is the typed control and interoperability layer that connects those systems
without allowing any one of them to define the pipeline's portable meaning.
