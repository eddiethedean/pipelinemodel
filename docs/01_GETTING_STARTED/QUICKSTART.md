# Five-Minute Quickstart

> **Status: Available in ETLantic 0.10.0.** Every API in this guide is shipped
> and the complete example is tested in CI.

This guide defines, validates, plans, and runs a typed pipeline using only the
core package and in-memory storage.

## Three terms you need

| Term | Meaning in this guide |
|---|---|
| **Binding** | Logical name for a source or sink (`binding="customer_source"`). The runtime resolves it to storage (here, in-memory). |
| **Profile** | Named environment for planning and running. Use `development` for the built-in local runtime examples. The CLI `plan` command defaults to `local`; `run` defaults to `development`. |
| **Implementation** | Engine-specific body registered with `@Transformation.implementation("local")` (or `"polars"` / `"pandas"` after installing those plugins). |

## 1. Install

ETLantic requires Python 3.11 or newer.

**Recommended (works today):** clone and sync

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eddiethedean/etlantic.git
cd etlantic
uv sync
uv run python -c "import etlantic; print(etlantic.__version__)"
```

When wheels are on PyPI:

```bash
python -m pip install 'etlantic>=0.10.0'
python -c "import etlantic; print(etlantic.__version__)"
```

If `pip install etlantic` fails with “No matching distribution,” use the
from-source path above. See [Installation](INSTALLATION.md) and
[Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## 2. Create `pipeline.py`

```python
from etlantic import (
    Data,
    Input,
    Output,
    Pipeline,
    PipelineRuntime,
    Sink,
    Source,
    Transformation,
)


class RawCustomer(Data):
    customer_id: int
    first_name: str
    last_name: str


class Customer(Data):
    customer_id: int
    full_name: str


class NormalizeCustomers(Transformation):
    customers: Input[RawCustomer]
    result: Output[Customer]


@NormalizeCustomers.implementation("local")
def normalize_customers(customers: list[RawCustomer]) -> list[Customer]:
    return [
        Customer(
            customer_id=customer.customer_id,
            full_name=f"{customer.first_name} {customer.last_name}",
        )
        for customer in customers
    ]


class CustomerPipeline(Pipeline):
    raw: Source[RawCustomer] = Source(binding="customer_source")
    normalized = NormalizeCustomers.step(customers=raw)
    curated: Sink[Customer] = Sink(
        input=normalized.result,
        binding="customer_sink",
    )


report = CustomerPipeline.validate()
report.raise_for_errors()

plan = CustomerPipeline.plan(profile="development")
print(f"Plan: {plan.plan_id}")

runtime = PipelineRuntime()
runtime.memory.seed(
    "customer_source",
    [
        RawCustomer(customer_id=1, first_name="Ada", last_name="Lovelace"),
        RawCustomer(customer_id=2, first_name="Grace", last_name="Hopper"),
    ],
)

run_report = CustomerPipeline.run(profile="development", runtime=runtime)
print(run_report.to_text())

for customer in runtime.memory.get("customer_sink"):
    print(customer.model_dump())
```

## 3. Run it

```bash
python pipeline.py
```

The final records are:

```text
{'customer_id': 1, 'full_name': 'Ada Lovelace'}
{'customer_id': 2, 'full_name': 'Grace Hopper'}
```

The exact generated plan and run identifiers vary, but the run status should
be `succeeded`.

## What happened

1. `Data` classes defined the input and output contracts.
2. `Transformation` declared the typed interface.
3. `implementation("local")` registered executable Python code.
4. `Pipeline` connected a named source, step, and sink.
5. Validation checked the graph before execution.
6. Planning produced a deterministic, secret-free `PipelinePlan`.
7. `PipelineRuntime` supplied in-memory source and sink storage.
8. `run()` returned a structured `PipelineRunReport`.

The same example is available at `examples/quickstart.py`.

## Next

- Keep going in this file: the full script above is self-contained (no clone
  required once the package is installed).
- From a checkout: file-backed JSON/CSV with
  `uv run python examples/file_storage.py`
- From a checkout: Polars/Pandas with
  `uv sync --group dataframes` then
  `uv run python examples/dataframe_parity.py polars`
- Inline second step (memory seed pattern already in the script above) —
  change the seeded rows and re-run.
- Build the example in smaller steps in [Your First Pipeline](FIRST_PIPELINE.md)
- Review [Current Capabilities and Limitations](CAPABILITIES.md)
- See [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) if the run fails
- Airflow compile (checkout): `uv sync --group airflow` then
  `uv run python examples/airflow_compile.py`
- SparkForge adapter (checkout): `uv sync --group sparkforge` then
  `uv run pytest tests/sparkforge -m sparkforge`
