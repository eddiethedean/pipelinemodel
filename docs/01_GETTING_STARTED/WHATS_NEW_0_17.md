# What's New in 0.17

ETLantic 0.17.0 expands portable transform coverage with platform
discoverability and multi-family graduation on Polars and PySpark.

## Gate A — Platform

- `etlantic plugin list --kind transform_compiler` inventories installed
  compilers with exact capability summaries
- Plan explain surfaces compiler capabilities and selection metadata
- Guide/packaging drift checks verify runtime↔compiler entry-point pairing
- Profile allowlists can no longer be bypassed by unfiltered compiler discovery
- Distinct `missing`/`invalid` literals fail closed unless a compiler claims
  `three_state_distinct`

## Gate B — Wave 1 (Polars + PySpark)

Graduated profiles:

- `portable-string-advanced/1`
- `portable-conversion/1`
- `portable-statistics/1`
- `portable-window/1` (not `/2`)

## Gate C — Wave 2 (Polars + PySpark)

Graduated profiles:

- `portable-complex-types/1`
- `portable-complex-values/1`
- `portable-reshape/1` (`explode`)

Pandas and SQL remain kernel + `portable-relational/1` only. Unsupported
graduated requirements fail during planning under `require`.

## Continuation (not in 0.17 exit)

`portable-relational-extended/1`, `portable-temporal-iana/1`,
`portable-nondeterministic/1`, and `portable-window/2` stay authorable but
unclaimed.

## Upgrade

See [Migration 0.16 → 0.17](../11_DEVELOPMENT/MIGRATION_0_16_TO_0_17.md) and the
[portable compiler matrix](../10_REFERENCE/PORTABLE_COMPILER_MATRIX.md).
