# Installation

Pipelantic 0.4 provides the typed modeling kernel, contract interoperability
(ODCS/DTCS/DPCS), multi-phase validation, profiles, deterministic planning,
and a local runtime that executes plans with Python callables, in-memory
artifacts, and stdlib JSON/CSV bindings. Dataframe/SQL/Spark plugins arrive
in later milestones.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for project and dependency management
- ContractModel as a companion package (installed automatically)

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eddiethedean/pipelantic.git
cd pipelantic
uv sync
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
```

`uv sync` installs runtime dependencies, the editable package, and the `dev`
group (pytest, ruff). The lockfile `uv.lock` pins exact versions.

### Common commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `uv sync` | Create/update `.venv` from `uv.lock` |
| `uv lock` | Refresh the lockfile after dependency changes |
| `uv run pytest` | Run tests |
| `uv run ruff check .` | Lint |
| `uv run ruff check --fix .` | Lint and apply safe fixes |
| `uv run ruff format .` | Format |

## Repository Layout

```text
pyproject.toml
uv.lock
.python-version
src/pipelantic/
tests/
docs/
```

## Verification

```bash
uv run python -c "import pipelantic; print(pipelantic.__version__)"
uv run pipelantic --help
```

## User Installation

```bash
pip install pipelantic
# or
uv add pipelantic
```

Backend plugins remain independently installable and are not required by the
core package.

Pandas, Polars, SQL, Spark, and Airflow plugins are not published as part of
Pipelantic 0.4. Do not install undocumented extras expecting those backends.

## Upgrade

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pipelantic
# or
uv lock --upgrade-package pipelantic
```

Review the
[changelog](https://github.com/eddiethedean/pipelantic/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
before upgrading between 0.x releases because breaking changes remain
possible.

## Installation Problems

See [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for Python-version errors, stale
virtual environments, missing implementations, and unsupported backend
examples.

## Dependency Philosophy

Pipelantic keeps the core install small. Dataframe engines, orchestrators,
and storage clients belong in optional plugins—not the base package.

See [Dependency Strategy](../11_DEVELOPMENT/DEPENDENCY_STRATEGY.md) for the
full dependency policy.
