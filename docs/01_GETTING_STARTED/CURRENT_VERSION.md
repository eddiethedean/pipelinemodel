# ETLantic 0.22 User Guide

This is the current manual for published ETLantic **0.22.0**. Core onboarding
paths below are available in 0.22; linked reference and design pages may also
describe Experimental, partial, or future work and retain their own status
labels. ETLantic 0.22.0 is **stable** only within the documented
single-tenant reference deployment boundary. The Plugin SDK ships as a
**Release Candidate** (protocol `/1` freeze-eligible, not frozen).

## Start here
