# Testing

## Run the current test suite

```bash
uv sync --locked
uv run pytest -q
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run python scripts/check_docs.py
uv run python scripts/build_docs.py
```

Run the narrowest relevant test directory while developing, then the complete
suite before opening a pull request. Current test areas include core validation
and planning plus `tests/dataframe`, `tests/sql`, `tests/spark`,
`tests/orchestration`, `tests/airflow`, `tests/prefect`, and
`tests/sparkforge`.

Current optional markers are `polars`, `pandas`, `sql`, `spark`,
`real_pyspark`, `airflow`, `prefect`, `keyring`, `sqlmodel`, and `sparkforge`;
`pyproject.toml` is authoritative. The baseline job excludes dependency-backed
markers:

```bash
uv run pytest -q -m "not sparkforge and not polars and not pandas and not sql and not spark and not real_pyspark and not airflow and not prefect and not keyring and not sqlmodel"
```

```bash
uv sync --group dataframes
uv run pytest -m polars
uv run pytest -m pandas

uv sync --group sql
uv run pytest -m sql

uv sync --group pyspark
uv run pytest -m spark

SPARKLESS_TEST_MODE=pyspark uv run pytest -m real_pyspark

uv sync --group prefect
uv run pytest -m prefect
```

To debug collection or plugin discovery, begin with `pytest --collect-only`,
then run one failing node with `-vv -x`. Never depend on plugin discovery order,
ambient environment variables, production credentials, or shared mutable
runtime state.

## Portable transformation conformance (shipped in 0.14)

Every compiler runs capability-selected fixtures from
`etlantic.testing.portable_transform_conformance`. Shared fixtures cover IR
canonicalization, null/type/error semantics, deterministic compilation,
multiple outputs, lazy/eager behavior, ownership, hostile bounded input,
redaction, and cross-engine normalized results. Advertising an operation or
function makes its fixture mandatory.

Plugin authors can run the public suite directly:

```python
from etlantic.testing import run_portable_transform_conformance_suite

run_portable_transform_conformance_suite(create_transform_compiler())
```

ETLantic testing must prove that typed models, portable contracts,
planning, and backend execution preserve the same semantics.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests cover:

- Annotation parsing
- Stable identifiers
- Port collection
- Graph construction
- Diagnostic rendering
- Registry behavior
- Profile merging
- Capability matching
- Plan serialization

Tests should avoid importing heavyweight optional backends unless they target an
integration.

## Model Definition Tests

Verify:

- Required and optional inputs
- Multiple outputs
- Parameter defaults and constraints
- Inheritance behavior
- Invalid annotations
- Forward references
- Generic source and sink types
- Step output typing

## Contract Tests

For ODCS, DTCS, and DPCS:

- Code-first generation
- Contract-first loading
- Semantic round trips
- Canonical output
- Supported-version dispatch
- Invalid document diagnostics
- Compatibility behavior

Normative fixtures should come from the corresponding standards where
available.

## Validation Tests

Test each validation phase independently:

- Model definition
- Contract integration
- Port compatibility
- Graph topology
- Profile bindings
- Plugin capabilities
- Runtime data boundaries

Diagnostics should be asserted by code, path, and severity rather than fragile
full-message matching unless testing rendering.

## Planner Tests

Planner tests should verify:

- Deterministic plans
- Implementation selection
- Binding resolution
- Execution region formation
- Materialization boundaries
- SQL and Spark fusion safety
- Hybrid backend boundaries
- Capability failures
- Absence of secrets

Equivalent input must produce equivalent canonical plans.

## Plugin Conformance

The public portable transform SDK provides a reusable compiler suite:

```python
from etlantic.testing import run_portable_transform_conformance_suite

run_portable_transform_conformance_suite(create_transform_compiler())
```

Broader reusable suites for other plugin families remain aspirational. Their
intended shape is:

```python
def test_plugin_conformance():
    assert_dataframe_plugin_conforms(plugin)
```

Conformance should cover:

- Protocol shape
- Capability accuracy
- Lifecycle and cleanup
- Sync and async callables
- Error normalization
- Cancellation
- Contract validation behavior
- Resource safety

See [Testing Plugins](../07_PLUGIN_SDK/TESTING_PLUGINS.md).

## Backend Integration Tests

Backend test environments should be isolated and optional:

- Pandas and Polars in-process
- SQLite or DuckDB for SQL smoke tests
- Spark local mode for PySpark
- Containerized databases where necessary
- Airflow compilation tests without requiring a scheduler for every test

Mark dependency-backed tests only with markers registered in `pyproject.toml`:

```text
polars
pandas
sql
spark
real_pyspark
airflow
prefect
keyring
sqlmodel
sparkforge
```

`unit`, `integration`, `slow`, and `network` are descriptive categories in
this guide, not registered pytest markers in 0.17. Add a marker to
`pyproject.toml` before using it.

## End-to-End Tests

Each primary workflow should validate the complete path:

```text
Python model
→ contracts
→ validation
→ plan
→ backend
→ results
→ lineage and generated docs
```

Representative cases:

- CSV to CSV with Polars
- CSV to SQL
- SQL to SQL with pushdown
- Pandas pipeline
- PySpark to Delta
- Structured Streaming
- Local execution and Airflow compilation

## Golden Tests

Golden files are appropriate for:

- Generated ODCS, DTCS, and DPCS
- Canonical `PipelinePlan`
- Diagnostics
- Mermaid and Graphviz
- Compiled Airflow DAGs
- SQL output

Updates must be reviewed as semantic changes, not accepted mechanically.

## Property-Based Testing

Use property-based tests for:

- Graph construction and cycle detection
- Identifier normalization
- Profile merging
- Plan serialization round trips
- Diff and compatibility invariants
- Schema normalization and fingerprint determinism
- Contract drift versus operational drift classification
- Schema-history idempotency and concurrent baseline updates
- Drift-policy precedence and fail-closed behavior
- Field-level impact analysis with complete and incomplete lineage
- Equivalent observations across dataframe, SQL, Spark, and Arrow inspectors
- Freshness windows across timezones, grace periods, and schedule boundaries
- Missing, late, duplicate, unexpected, and partially published partitions
- Minimum-safe invalidation and repair closure
- Idempotency and retry matrices for pure, transactional, compensatable, and
  unsafe operations
- Portable write and materialization semantics across supported backends
- SQLModel-to-`Data` mapping, deterministic model generation, migration safety,
  repository transactions, tenant isolation, and API field separation
- Reconciliation snapshots, tolerances, and control totals
- Backfill range, partition, state-isolation, cancellation, and resume behavior
- Cross-backend null, precision, ordering, timezone, and invalid-data parity
- Plan and environment fingerprint stability and semantic drift classification
- Quality-trend windows, deduplicated notifications, and statistical privacy
  budgets
- Random valid transformation signatures

## Async Testing

Tests must cover:

- Sync implementations
- Async implementations
- Mixed DAG branches
- Cancellation
- Timeouts
- Cleanup after failure
- Sync hooks returning awaitables
- Async resource providers

Avoid tests that depend on timing alone. Use synchronization primitives and
controlled fakes.

## Type-Checking Tests

ETLantic ships `py.typed` and a typed root facade stub
(`src/etlantic/__init__.pyi`). Positive fixtures live under
`tests/typing/pass/`; negative fixtures under `tests/typing/fail/` document
demoted root imports. CI does not yet fail the build on a dedicated pyright
fail-suite run — treat these as contributor anchors and expand them when the
typing gate lands.

```text
tests/typing/pass/etl_facade.py
tests/typing/fail/demoted_root_import.py
```

Recommended application import style:

```python
import etlantic as etl
```

Curated root symbols and lazy namespaces (`etl.sql`, `etl.testing`, …) are
covered by `tests/unit/test_root_facade.py` and
`scripts/check_surface_inventory.py`.

## Coverage

Coverage is a signal, not the goal. Critical planner, validation, security, and
cleanup branches require direct tests even when aggregate coverage is high.

## Test Isolation

- Use explicit runtimes and registries.
- Do not depend on plugin discovery order.
- Reset environment variables.
- Use temporary directories.
- Do not share mutable dataframe artifacts across tests.
- Never use production credentials.
- Treat security tests as release gates rather than optional integration tests.

## Security Testing

The security suite should cover unsafe deserialization, parser limits, path
traversal, SSRF, planning purity, plugin allowlists, injection, secret leakage,
artifact and cache isolation, outbound destination policy, credential cleanup,
and denial-of-service budgets.

Security-sensitive parsers and resolvers should receive property-based tests
and fuzzing where practical.

## Documentation Tests

Code examples should be executable or syntax-checked. Generated examples should
be verified in CI so documentation does not drift from the public API.
