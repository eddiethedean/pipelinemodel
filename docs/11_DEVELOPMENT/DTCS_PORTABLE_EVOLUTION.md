# DTCS and Portable Transformation Evolution

Status: Internal standards and release plan  
Owner: ETLantic/DTCS publisher and maintainers  
Applies to: ETLantic 0.11+

The adopted change records are
[DTCS 2.0 Portable Relational Publication Record](DTCS_PORTABLE_SPEC_PROPOSAL.md)
and
[DTCS 3.0 Rich Portable Analytics Publication Record](DTCS_3_0_SPEC_PROPOSAL.md).

## Decision

DTCS is the normative and executable semantic kernel for portable
transformations. ETLantic does not maintain a second transformation-plan model.

The `dtcs` package will expose the canonical, versioned Transformation Plan
types, portable type system, operation/function identities, semantic metadata,
capability requirements, canonical serialization, and validation hooks.

ETLantic provides:

- the PySpark-inspired `etlantic.transform` authoring facade
- `@Transformation.portable` lifecycle and source-aware diagnostics
- DTCS plan attachment to transformation contracts
- pipeline planning and compiler selection
- backend compiler protocols, execution, lineage, and reports
- shared plugin conformance orchestration

Plugins consume a validated DTCS Transformation Plan. They do not consume an
independent ETLantic expression model.

## Published DTCS baseline assessment

The published `SPEC.md` already provides the architectural spine required by
portable transformations:

- Chapter 13 makes the Transformation Plan the authoritative semantic IR.
- Chapter 14 defines Engine Capability Models and mandatory capability
  matching.
- Chapter 15 requires compilers to consume validated Transformation Plans and
  produce backend Execution Plans.
- Chapter 17 makes Semantic Actions the only standardized mechanism for
  modifying datasets.
- Chapter 18 defines typed, null-aware, deterministic Functions.
- Chapters 22-26 define registries, conformance, security, independent
  versioning, and governance.
- Appendix A publishes concrete `dtcs:` identifiers and distinguishes null,
  missing, and invalid values.

ETLantic must use these existing concepts directly. The portable initiative is
primarily an expansion and concretization of DTCS registries/profiles plus an
ergonomic ETLantic authoring facade—not the creation of a new semantic system.

### Current standard-library coverage

The published Semantic Action library already includes `dtcs:project`,
`dtcs:select`, `dtcs:filter`, `dtcs:aggregate`, `dtcs:group`, `dtcs:join`,
`dtcs:sort`, `dtcs:union`, `dtcs:partition`, and `dtcs:derive`.

The Function library already includes `dtcs:lower`, `dtcs:upper`,
`dtcs:concat`, `dtcs:substr`, `dtcs:replace`, `dtcs:coalesce`, `dtcs:length`,
portable conversions, numeric min/max/abs, containment, and null/missing
predicates.

ETLantic's initial portable facade should map to these identifiers wherever
their published parameter and result semantics are sufficient.

### Capabilities added for the PySpark-inspired surface

DTCS 2.0 now publishes the semantic foundation for:

- expression-bearing project and filter action parameters
- add/replace column, rename, drop, distinct, deduplicate, and limit actions
- join types, arbitrary join predicates, collision handling, and null-safe keys
- union-by-name and missing-column policy
- multi-key sorting, direction, and null placement
- multiple aggregate expressions, aliases, and empty-input behavior
- boolean/comparison/arithmetic operators with precise type promotion
- strict and tolerant casts
- conditional expressions
- richer string/date/time functions
- windows and frame boundaries
- action/function capability identifiers at the granularity compilers need
- canonical serialized Transformation Plan and conformance-profile schemas

ETLantic can implement facade syntax for these published capabilities. Window
and complex-type profiles remain experimental, and functions absent from the
DTCS 2.0 registries—such as regex helpers, collection constructors, `explode`,
statistical aggregates, random values, UUIDs, and raw `F.expr()` text—remain
excluded or require a future governed DTCS revision.

### Value-state correction

Portable semantics must distinguish DTCS value states:

- null: present with a null payload
- missing: `{"$dtcs": "missing"}`
- invalid: `{"$dtcs": "invalid"}` with optional reason

ETLantic and its compilers must not collapse missing or invalid into null.
Function and action behavior follows the registry's declared semantics for all
three states.

## Publishing authority

ETLantic and DTCS share a publisher. The publisher can evolve the DTCS
specification and `dtcs` package when portable transformation requirements
expose missing concepts or ambiguous semantics.

Shared authority reduces coordination latency; it does not remove the DTCS
governance requirements in Chapter 26. Every standards change still requires:

- explicit normative specification text
- a versioned DTCS schema and Python package release
- canonical fixtures and compatibility classification
- ETLantic dependency-range and adapter updates
- compiler capability and conformance updates
- migration guidance for breaking changes

Normative proposals include a problem statement, proposed solution,
compatibility impact, migration considerations, and affected artifacts; they
undergo technical review before adoption. Published documents and identifiers
remain immutable.

ETLantic documentation must not describe unpublished DTCS behavior as if it
were already normative.

## Versioned boundaries

Three identifiers remain distinct:

| Boundary | Identifier | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Transformation semantics and plan schema | `dtcs.transform-plan/2` (v1 readable) | DTCS |
| Python authoring profile | `etlantic.transform/1` | ETLantic |
| Compiler plugin protocol | `etlantic.transform-compiler/1` | ETLantic Plugin SDK |

The authoring profile MUST normalize losslessly to the DTCS plan. The compiler
protocol MUST declare which DTCS plan versions it accepts. Matching an ETLantic
authoring version does not imply compiler or DTCS compatibility.

## Dependency direction

```text
DTCS specification
        ↓
dtcs package: canonical plan + semantics
        ↓
ETLantic authoring facade + planner
        ↓
ETLantic compiler protocol
        ↓
Polars / PySpark / Pandas / SQL compilers
```

The `dtcs` package must remain free of ETLantic and backend dependencies.
ETLantic may depend on a compatible `dtcs` range. Plugins may consume public
DTCS models through ETLantic's compiler context but must not import ETLantic
private adapters.

## Standards change workflow

### 1. Capture a semantic requirement

Start from an engine-independent use case and identify whether DTCS already
defines it. Backend convenience alone is not sufficient.

### 2. Specify meaning in DTCS

Add or clarify:

- semantic action or expression node
- function/operator identity
- types, coercion, nullability, and errors
- determinism, ordering, and state behavior
- capability requirement
- canonical examples and edge cases

### 3. Release the `dtcs` package

Publish canonical models, validation, serialization, and fixtures. The package
version and supported specification version must be inspectable independently.

### 4. Expose ETLantic authoring syntax

Add the PySpark-inspired facade only after the DTCS package can represent the
meaning. ETLantic syntax constructs public DTCS plan objects or a thin builder
that normalizes immediately to them.

### 5. Implement at least two compilers

New semantic families require two independent compiler implementations before
they are considered portable and stable. Experimental single-compiler support
must be labeled and capability-gated.

### 6. Publish conformance and migration evidence

Update shared fixtures, golden plans, compiler matrices, changelogs, dependency
ranges, and migration guidance before release.

## Change classification

| Change | Expected version treatment |
|---|---|
| Add optional operation/function | DTCS minor; compiler capability opt-in |
| Clarify wording without changing results | DTCS patch plus fixture if useful |
| Add required field with defaultable meaning | DTCS minor with compatibility adapter |
| Change null/type/error/order semantics | DTCS plan major |
| Remove or rename operation/function identity | DTCS plan major with migration |
| Change ETLantic spelling only | ETLantic authoring-profile version |
| Change compiler lifecycle only | compiler-protocol version |

## Required DTCS package surface

The 0.11 work should propose public imports similar to:

```python
from dtcs.plan import (
    ColumnExpression,
    DatasetExpression,
    TransformationPlan,
)
from dtcs.semantics import (
    FunctionDefinition,
    OperationDefinition,
    PortableType,
    SemanticRegistry,
)
from dtcs.validation import validate_transformation_plan
```

The illustrative Python import names above must be verified against the public
`dtcs` 0.13 API before implementation; the underlying DTCS 2.0 and 3.0 plan,
registries, profiles, validation, and conformance semantics are published.
ETLantic must depend only on public DTCS imports and must not duplicate their
Pydantic/dataclass models.

## Release train

Each ETLantic portable milestone begins with a DTCS readiness gate:

| ETLantic | DTCS prerequisite | Current state |
|---|---|---|
| 0.11 | full Portable Relational + Rich Portable Analytics authoring over `dtcs.transform-plan/2` | semantics published in DTCS 2.0/3.0 / `dtcs` 0.13; ETLantic facade→IR remains |
| 0.12 | exact compiler capability requirements + Polars **kernel** claims only | published; ETLantic explain/compiler integration remains |
| 0.13 | relational compiler claims (joins, unions, grouping, aggregation, ordering) on Polars + PySpark | published in `portable-relational/1` (+ candidate `/2`); authoring owned by 0.11 |
| 0.14 | validation and conformance foundation | published; ETLantic plugin-facing fixture packaging remains |
| 0.15 | SQL lowering + two-compiler graduation of advanced families | 2.0 experimental + 3.0 Rich Portable Analytics published; authoring owned by 0.11; compilers remain |

ETLantic selects `dtcs>=0.13,<1` for the published DTCS 3.0 foundation
(retaining 2.0 readability). Dependency bounds must never be treated as
compiler-profile compatibility before CI passes the corresponding
cross-project fixtures.

## Governance artifacts

Every portable feature proposal should link:

1. DTCS specification change or clarification
2. `dtcs` package release/version
3. ETLantic authoring API and plan mapping
4. compiler capability identifiers
5. conformance fixtures
6. migration and compatibility notes

This chain keeps standards meaning, authoring ergonomics, and backend execution
aligned while allowing both projects to evolve quickly under shared
publishing authority.
