# Roadmap Summary

ETLantic **0.22.0** ships the **Plugin SDK Release Candidate**. Milestones
describe capability order, not release-date commitments.

## Shipped: 0.15 through 0.20

ETLantic **0.15.0** closed Safe SQL Lowering and the LocalScheduler companion.

ETLantic **0.16.0** shipped authoring vocabulary cleanup and optional
`etlantic-prefect` `ExecutionScheduler`.

ETLantic **0.17.0** shipped portable coverage expansion (platform + Wave 1/2
on Polars + PySpark). Pandas and SQL remain kernel + `portable-relational/1`.

ETLantic **0.18.0** shipped Gate A versioned tabular interchange
(`etlantic.interchange/1`) for Polars↔Pandas. See
[What's New in 0.18](../01_GETTING_STARTED/WHATS_NEW_0_18.md).

ETLantic **0.19.0** shipped the **Contract and Configuration Freeze**:
deep plan immutability, fingerprint trust-boundary verify, `security_mode`,
strict profile resolution, wire schema gates, surface inventory, and
pre-1.0 deprecation schedule. See
[What's New in 0.19](../01_GETTING_STARTED/WHATS_NEW_0_19.md).

ETLantic **0.20.0** shipped **Trust, Isolation, and Safe I/O**:
pre-import plugin manifests, `SafeIoPolicy`, artifact/cache isolation,
outbound SSRF policy, serialization bans, versioned security events, and
release SBOM digests / attestations / OIDC-preferred publish. See
[What's New in 0.20](../01_GETTING_STARTED/WHATS_NEW_0_20.md) and
[Exit gate 0.20](EXIT_GATE_0_20.md).

## 0.18 Gate A (still current)

Gate A = **0.18.0** (interchange baseline). DataFusion remains a
**non-blocking** Gate B experiment (`etlantic-datafusion` Experimental;
not graduated).

## Shipped: 0.21

ETLantic **0.21.0** shipped **Cohesive CLI and Authoring Experience**:
`init`, `doctor`, profile commands, durable workspace, declarative assets,
`plan diff`, and cross-invocation reports. See
[What's New in 0.21](../01_GETTING_STARTED/WHATS_NEW_0_21.md) and
[Exit gate 0.21](EXIT_GATE_0_21.md).

## Shipped: 0.22

ETLantic **0.22.0** shipped the **Plugin SDK Release Candidate**:
capability-driven engine identity, `etlantic.capabilities/1`, hardened
public conformance (including Spark), curated `import etlantic as etl`,
`etlantic plugin compatibility`, and out-of-monorepo
`etlantic-plugin-echo`. Protocol `/1` is freeze-eligible, not frozen. See
[What's New in 0.22](../01_GETTING_STARTED/WHATS_NEW_0_22.md) and
[Exit gate 0.22](EXIT_GATE_0_22.md).

## Toward 1.0

The 1.0 goal is a stable foundation with frozen contracts (0.19), completed
trust/isolation gates (**0.20.0**), cohesive CLI (**0.21.0**), and
Plugin SDK with frozen `/1` protocols (post-0.22 RC feedback).
TransformationModel incubation is deferred to post-1.0 phases.

> **Production use is supported only within the documented reference
> envelope.** See the [Evaluator Brief](../01_GETTING_STARTED/EVALUATOR.md).
