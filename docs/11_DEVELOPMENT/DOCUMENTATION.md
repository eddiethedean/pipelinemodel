# Documentation Contributions

Documentation is part of the public API.

## Required Page Status

Every page describing product behavior must be one of:

- **Available in 0.5**
- **Partially available**
- **Future design**
- **Normative specification**
- **Internal project plan**

Future design must not be described as a complete or runnable current example.

## Local Checks

```bash
uv run pytest -q
uv run python scripts/check_docs.py
uv run mkdocs build --strict
```

The example test imports and runs `examples/quickstart.py`. Documentation CI
also checks release-version consistency and rejects future-backend claims in
the runnable examples index.

## Writing Rules

- Lead with the user outcome.
- State prerequisites and expected output.
- Use only shipped APIs in beginner documentation.
- Put proposed APIs in the Future Design section.
- Link to the compatibility matrix rather than duplicating dependency ranges.
- Update the changelog, status page, and navigation when release boundaries
  change.
