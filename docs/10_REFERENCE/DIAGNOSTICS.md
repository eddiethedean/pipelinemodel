# Diagnostics Reference

Diagnostics are structured findings produced while loading, inspecting,
validating, planning, compiling, or executing a pipeline.

They are intended for people, CI systems, editors, and plugin tooling.

## Diagnostic Model

A diagnostic should contain:

```python
Diagnostic(
    code="PMPIPE201",
    severity=Severity.ERROR,
    message='Unknown input "cleaned_customer".',
    path=("pipeline", "publish", "input"),
    source=SourceLocation(...),
    help='Did you mean "cleaned_customers"?',
    related=(...),
    metadata={...},
)
```

## Severity

| Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `error` | The operation cannot safely continue |
| `warning` | The model is valid but may be unsafe or surprising |
| `info` | Relevant explanatory information |
| `hint` | Optional improvement or editor assistance |

Only errors make a validation report invalid by default.

## Diagnostic Namespaces

ETLantic-owned codes should use stable categories:

```text
PMSRCxxx   Source and import loading
PMTYPExxx  Type annotations and model introspection
PMDATAxxx  Data-contract integration
PMTRNxxx   Transformation definitions and implementations
PMXFORMxxx Portable transformation authoring, IR, compilers, and execution
PMPIPExxx  Pipeline topology and wiring
PMPLANxxx  Planning and capability resolution
PMPLUGxxx  Plugin trust / allowlist (e.g. PMPLUG401, PMPLUG402)
PMORCHxxx  Orchestration / compile diagnostics
PMSPARKxxx Spark capability and runtime diagnostics
PMDFxxx    Dataframe plugin diagnostics
PMXFORMxxx Portable transform authoring / compiler diagnostics
PMEXECxxx  Execution lifecycle
PMCFGxxx   Configuration and profiles
PMGENxxx   Contract and documentation generation
PMINTxxx   Internal framework invariants
```

Standards and plugins retain their own namespaces, such as `ODCS`, `DTCS`,
`DPCS`, or a documented plugin prefix.

## Source Locations

When available, diagnostics should identify:

- File or URI
- Line and column
- Python object or class
- Contract path
- Pipeline node and port
- Generated artifact

Example:

```text
src/pipelines/customer.py:42:9 PMPIPE201

The step "publish_customers" expects Customer, but received RawCustomer
from "load_customers.result".

help: connect the output of NormalizeCustomers or change the sink contract
```

## Related Locations

A diagnostic may refer to more than one place:

- The consumer port
- The producer port
- The relevant contract declaration
- The selected implementation

Related locations make type and compatibility errors explainable without
flattening them into a single message.

## Reports

Operations return reports containing diagnostics:

```python
report = CustomerPipeline.validate()

if not report.valid:
    report.raise_for_errors()
```

Reports should support:

- Filtering by severity or code
- Stable ordering
- JSON serialization
- Human rendering
- SARIF export
- Summary counts

## Exceptions and Diagnostics

Expected user errors should become diagnostics. Exceptions are reserved for
invalid API usage, I/O failures configured as fatal, plugin crashes, or broken
framework invariants.

An exception raised by a convenience method should retain its report:

```python
try:
    CustomerPipeline.plan(profile="production")
except PipelineValidationError as exc:
    print(exc.report)
```

## Validation Diagnostics

Validation may report:

- Invalid data-contract types
- Missing transformation inputs
- Incompatible output and input contracts
- Cycles
- Duplicate identifiers
- Invalid parameters
- Missing sinks
- Unsupported subpipeline boundaries
- Invalid portable expression names, types, outputs, or bounded structure

## Planning Diagnostics

Planning may report:

- No compatible implementation
- Missing plugin
- Unsupported capability
- Ambiguous binding
- Unsafe artifact boundary
- Unsupported orchestrator behavior
- Incompatible SQL or Spark dialect
- Unsupported portable operation, function, type, or semantic mode
- Ambiguous portable/native selection or prohibited fallback

Portable diagnostics use expression paths such as
`outputs.result.project.full_name` and reserve these ranges:

```text
PMXFORM1xx authoring and signatures
PMXFORM2xx names, types, contracts, and outputs
PMXFORM3xx compiler selection and capabilities
PMXFORM4xx lowering and semantic mismatch
PMXFORM5xx portable runtime execution
PMXFORM8xx security and bounded-input rejection
PMXFORM9xx internal invariants
```

Shipped authoring codes in 0.11 include:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PMXFORM101` | Portable definition signature mismatch or excluded `F.expr` |
| `PMXFORM110` | Return value is not a `FrameExpr` / output mapping |
| `PMXFORM201` | Declared output missing from portable return value |
| `PMXFORM202` | Undeclared output returned |
| `PMXFORM203` | Single `FrameExpr` return with multiple outputs |
| `PMXFORM801`–`803` | Callable / binary / secret capture rejection |
| `PMXFORM810`–`812` | Document size / node count / depth budget exceeded |
| `PMXFORM901` | Unexpected plan protocol identity |

## Execution Diagnostics

Execution findings should distinguish:

- Failed
- Timed out
- Cancelled
- Skipped
- Retrying
- Abandoned
- Invalid input data
- Invalid output data

Runtime exceptions should be normalized without hiding the original exception.

## Suppression

Suppressions should be explicit, narrow, and reviewable:

```python
class CustomerPipeline(Pipeline):
    model_config = {
        "diagnostic_suppressions": {
            "PMPIPE410": "Legacy source retained during migration",
        }
    }
```

Suppressing errors that protect required semantics should not be allowed.

## Machine-Readable Output

```bash
etlantic validate path/to/pipeline.py:CustomerPipeline --format json
etlantic validate path/to/pipeline.py:CustomerPipeline --format sarif
```

Machine output should use stable field names and diagnostic codes even when
human wording improves.

## Plugin Requirements

Plugins should:

- Emit structured diagnostics rather than printing
- Use stable documented codes
- Attach node and plugin identity
- Preserve causal exceptions
- Avoid leaking secrets
- Suggest remediation when possible
