## Tested versus declared

The core CI matrix runs linting and the core test suite on Ubuntu, Windows, and
macOS with Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13. This is the broadest tested platform
surface for 0.14.0.

Optional plugin jobs run primarily on Ubuntu with Python 3.11. Polars and
Pandas each have dedicated dataframe/compiler/conformance jobs. SQL runs
against SQLite and PostgreSQL 16. PySpark compiler and differential coverage
uses the sparkless compatibility backend by default; real JVM PySpark checks
are a separate opt-in path. Airflow, keyring, SQLModel, and SparkForge also
have dedicated Ubuntu/3.11 jobs.

Package metadata declares these backend dependency ranges:

| Package or extra | Declared backend range |
|---|---|
| `etlantic-polars` | `polars>=1.0,<2`; optional `pyarrow>=14` |
| `etlantic-pandas` | `pandas>=2.2,<3`; optional `pyarrow>=14` |
| `etlantic-pyspark` | `pyspark>=3.5,<4`; optional `delta-spark>=3.0,<4` |
| `etlantic-sql` | `sqlalchemy>=2.0,<3`, `psycopg[binary]>=3.1,<4` |
| `etlantic-sqlmodel` | `sqlmodel>=0.0.22,<1` |
| `etlantic-keyring` | `keyring` (no narrower range declared) |
| `etlantic-airflow` | No Apache Airflow runtime dependency; it compiles DAG source |
| `etlantic[otel]` / `[observability]` | `opentelemetry-api>=1.36,<2` |
| `etlantic[arrow]` | `pyarrow>=14` |

A declared range means the resolver may install that version; it does not mean
every backend version and operating system combination is exercised in CI.
For a controlled deployment, test the exact resolved environment and pin
`etlantic==0.15.0` plus every official plugin to `==0.15.0`.

Core extras already enforce exact official plugin versions, for example
`etlantic[polars]==0.15.0` depends on `etlantic-polars==0.15.0`. The 0.14.0
official plugin source metadata accepts core `etlantic>=0.15.0,<0.16`, which is
minor-matched but less exact. Published, older, or third-party plugin metadata
may use a broader bound such as `etlantic>=0.14,<1.0`; do not treat that broad
specifier as evidence of tested cross-minor compatibility. Match the core and
official plugin minor versions, and prefer exact pins for reproducibility.

## Portable transformation profiles

DTCS publication does not mean the ETLantic facade or plugin compilers are
already implemented. Compatibility is tracked independently:

| DTCS profile | Spec status | ETLantic authoring (0.11) | ETLantic compilers |
|---|---|---|---|
