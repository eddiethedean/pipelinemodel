# Specifications

This directory contains normative specifications owned by the Pipelantic
ecosystem.

- [DTCS 1.0 Specification](DTCS_SPEC.md) defines transformation-contract
  semantics.
- [DPCS 1.0 Specification](DPCS_SPEC.md) defines pipeline-contract semantics.

ODCS is an external standard and is not copied into this repository. See the
[ODCS Integration Guide](../03_DATA_CONTRACTS/ODCS.md) for Pipelantic's
relationship with the upstream specification.

## Normative Versus Integration Documentation

Normative specifications define contract meaning with requirement language such
as `MUST`, `SHOULD`, and `MAY`.

Integration guides explain how Pipelantic authors, loads, validates,
generates, and references those contracts:

- [ODCS Integration](../03_DATA_CONTRACTS/ODCS.md)
- [DTCS Integration](../04_TRANSFORMATIONS/DTCS.md)
- [DPCS Integration](../05_PIPELINES/DPCS.md)

Pipelantic implementation details must not silently redefine normative
contract semantics.
