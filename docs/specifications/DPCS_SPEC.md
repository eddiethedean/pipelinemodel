# DPCS 1.0 Specification

**Status:** Draft\
**Version:** 1.0.0-draft

# Chapter 1 --- Introduction

## 1. Purpose

This chapter defines the purpose, scope, objectives, and foundational
principles of the **Data Pipeline Contract Standard (DPCS)**.

DPCS is an implementation-independent specification for describing
portable, contract-first data pipelines. A DPCS Pipeline Contract
defines the logical structure of a pipeline, the relationships between
its constituent steps, the contracts that govern its inputs and outputs,
and the semantic guarantees that SHALL be preserved regardless of the
orchestration technology used to execute it.

Unless explicitly identified as informative, every requirement in this
chapter is normative.

## 2. Scope

DPCS specifies Pipeline Contracts, pipeline interfaces, pipeline graphs,
pipeline steps, contract references, execution requirements, scheduling
intent, quality gates, failure semantics, lineage, compatibility,
diagnostics, and conformance.

DPCS does not prescribe workflow engines, schedulers, execution
runtimes, storage systems, or programming languages.

## 3. Design Goals

The DPCS specification SHALL be:

-   implementation independent
-   contract first
-   platform neutral
-   deterministic where declared
-   machine readable
-   extensible
-   interoperable
-   version aware

## 4. Non-Goals

This specification SHALL NOT:

-   define dataset schemas
-   define transformation semantics
-   prescribe workflow engine internals
-   require a specific orchestration technology
-   define scheduling algorithms
-   mandate infrastructure providers

## 5. Relationship to Other Standards

ODCS defines what data is.

DTCS defines how data changes.

DPCS defines how validated transformations compose into complete data
pipelines.

## 6. Architectural Principles

1.  Pipeline definition is independent of execution.
2.  Pipeline semantics are independent of orchestration technology.
3.  Contracts are the authoritative source of pipeline behavior.
4.  Planning and orchestration are distinct processing phases.
5.  Observable behavior SHALL be preserved across conforming
    implementations.

## 8. Conformance Language

The key words SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, and MAY are to be
interpreted as described by RFC 2119 and RFC 8174 when presented in
uppercase.

## 9. Audience

This specification is intended for standards authors, platform
architects, data engineers, orchestration engine developers, compiler
authors, tooling vendors, and governance teams.

## 10. Summary

The Data Pipeline Contract Standard establishes a portable,
implementation-independent model for describing complete data pipelines
as contracts rather than implementations. By separating pipeline
definition from orchestration technology, DPCS enables organizations to
validate, govern, analyze, version, and migrate pipelines while
preserving semantic intent across heterogeneous execution platforms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Chapter 2 --- Core Concepts

## 1. Purpose

This chapter defines the normative core concepts of the Data Pipeline
Contract Standard (DPCS).

The concepts defined in this chapter establish the common vocabulary
used throughout the specification. Conforming implementations SHALL
interpret these concepts consistently.

Unless explicitly identified as informative, all requirements in this
chapter are normative.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Pipeline

A Pipeline is a logical composition of one or more processing steps that
transform one or more input datasets into one or more output datasets.

A Pipeline SHALL be described by a Pipeline Contract.

A Pipeline is independent of any specific orchestration technology or
execution environment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Pipeline Contract

A Pipeline Contract is the normative description of a Pipeline.

A Pipeline Contract SHALL define the pipeline identity, interfaces,
graph, step definitions, contract references, execution requirements,
and any additional information required by this specification.

The Pipeline Contract is the authoritative source of pipeline semantics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Pipeline Step

A Pipeline Step is an addressable unit of work within a Pipeline.

Each Pipeline Step SHALL possess a stable identifier.

A Pipeline Step MAY reference:

-   a DTCS Transformation Contract
-   a nested Pipeline Contract
-   an implementation-defined operation through an extension

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Pipeline Graph

A Pipeline Graph defines the dependency relationships among Pipeline
Steps.

The Pipeline Graph SHALL express logical execution dependencies rather
than implementation-specific scheduling behavior.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Pipeline Interface

A Pipeline Interface defines the externally visible inputs and outputs
of a Pipeline.

Interfaces SHALL establish the contractual boundary between a Pipeline
and external systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Contract References

Pipeline Contracts SHALL reference external contracts rather than
duplicate their semantics.

References MAY include:

-   Data Contracts
-   Transformation Contracts
-   Pipeline Contracts

Referenced contracts retain their own identities, versions, and
compatibility requirements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Pipeline Plan

A Pipeline Plan is the canonical, implementation-independent
representation of a validated Pipeline Contract.

The Pipeline Plan SHALL preserve the semantic intent of the originating
Pipeline Contract.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Orchestrator Binding

An Orchestrator Binding translates a Pipeline Plan into an
implementation-specific representation suitable for a target
orchestration platform.

Bindings SHALL preserve the observable semantics of the Pipeline Plan.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Execution Runtime

An Execution Runtime executes an Orchestrator Binding.

Runtime behavior is outside the scope of this specification except where
necessary to preserve contractual semantics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 11. Semantic Preservation

Throughout processing, conforming implementations SHALL preserve:

-   pipeline identity
-   declared interfaces
-   dependency relationships
-   contract references
-   lineage
-   observable behavior

Implementation details MAY differ provided these semantics remain
equivalent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 12. Summary

The concepts defined in this chapter form the conceptual foundation of
DPCS. They establish a clear separation between pipeline definition,
planning, orchestration, and execution, enabling portable,
contract-first pipelines across heterogeneous platforms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Chapter 3 --- Canonical Object Model

## 1. Purpose

This chapter defines the normative Canonical Object Model (COM) for the
Data Pipeline Contract Standard (DPCS).

The Canonical Object Model is the authoritative in-memory representation
of a Pipeline Contract. Every conforming implementation SHALL construct
or operate on a logically equivalent Canonical Object Model regardless
of the source serialization format.

Unless explicitly identified as informative, all requirements in this
chapter are normative.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Design Goals

The Canonical Object Model SHALL be:

-   implementation independent
-   serialization independent
-   deterministic
-   machine readable
-   extensible
-   version aware

The Canonical Object Model SHALL preserve the complete semantic meaning
of a Pipeline Contract.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Canonical Representation

A Pipeline Contract SHALL be transformed into a Canonical Object Model
before semantic validation, planning, compatibility analysis, or
orchestrator binding.

Equivalent Pipeline Contracts expressed in different serialization
formats SHALL produce semantically equivalent Canonical Object Models.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Root Object

The root object SHALL represent a single Pipeline Contract.

The root object SHALL include:

-   pipeline identity
-   metadata
-   interface definitions
-   pipeline graph
-   pipeline steps
-   contract references
-   execution requirements
-   quality gates
-   lineage information
-   extension data

Additional fields MAY be defined through the DPCS Extensibility Model.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Object Identity

Every addressable object within the Canonical Object Model SHALL possess
a stable identity within the scope of the Pipeline Contract.

Identifiers SHALL remain stable throughout parsing, validation,
planning, and orchestrator binding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Object Relationships

Relationships between objects SHALL be represented explicitly.

Implementations SHALL preserve:

-   parent-child relationships
-   graph relationships
-   contract references
-   dependency relationships
-   lineage relationships

Relationship semantics SHALL NOT depend upon serialization order.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Serialization Independence

The Canonical Object Model SHALL NOT depend upon any specific
serialization format.

Equivalent YAML, JSON, TOML, XML, or future serializations SHALL produce
equivalent Canonical Object Models when expressing equivalent Pipeline
Contracts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Extension Preservation

Unknown extension fields SHALL be preserved when permitted by the DPCS
Extensibility Model.

Extension preservation SHALL NOT modify standardized semantics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Validation Requirements

Implementations SHALL validate:

-   required objects
-   identifier uniqueness
-   relationship consistency
-   graph integrity
-   reference integrity
-   extension structure

Validation failures SHALL produce standardized Diagnostics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Semantic Preservation

Construction of the Canonical Object Model SHALL preserve:

-   pipeline identity
-   pipeline interfaces
-   graph topology
-   step definitions
-   contract references
-   declared execution intent

Construction SHALL NOT introduce observable semantic changes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 11. Conformance

A conforming implementation SHALL:

-   construct a semantically equivalent Canonical Object Model
-   preserve object identity
-   preserve object relationships
-   preserve extension information where required
-   reject structurally invalid Pipeline Contracts through standardized
    Diagnostics

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 12. Summary

The Canonical Object Model provides the semantic foundation for all
subsequent DPCS processing. By separating serialization from semantics,
DPCS enables independent implementations to perform validation,
planning, compatibility analysis, and orchestrator binding using a
common, implementation-independent representation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Chapter 4 --- Pipeline Interface

## 1. Purpose

This chapter defines the normative Pipeline Interface Model for the Data
Pipeline Contract Standard (DPCS).

A Pipeline Interface specifies the externally visible inputs and outputs
of a Pipeline Contract. Interfaces establish the contractual boundary
between a pipeline and the systems, datasets, services, or pipelines
with which it interacts.

Unless explicitly identified as informative, all requirements in this
chapter are normative.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Design Goals

The Pipeline Interface Model SHALL be:

-   implementation independent
-   contract first
-   machine readable
-   deterministic
-   version aware

Pipeline interfaces SHALL describe observable behavior without
prescribing execution details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Interface Model

Every Pipeline Contract SHALL define one Pipeline Interface.

A Pipeline Interface SHALL describe:

-   contract references
-   metadata required by this specification

The interface SHALL represent the complete external boundary of the
Pipeline Contract.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Pipeline Inputs

Pipeline inputs identify the external datasets, streams, events, or
artifacts consumed by a pipeline.

Each input SHALL possess:

-   a stable identifier
-   an interface name
-   a declared contract reference
-   a logical purpose

Inputs MAY reference:

-   Data Contracts
-   external systems
-   outputs from other Pipeline Contracts

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Pipeline Outputs

Pipeline outputs identify the externally visible products produced by a
pipeline.

Each output SHALL possess:

-   a declared contract reference
-   a logical purpose

Outputs SHALL represent the observable results of successful pipeline
execution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Contract References

Inputs and outputs SHOULD reference external contracts rather than
duplicate their definitions.

Referenced contracts SHALL retain independent identities, versions, and
compatibility requirements.

Implementations SHALL validate referenced contracts according to
applicable DPCS profiles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Interface Compatibility

Interface compatibility SHALL be evaluated independently of execution
technology.

Compatibility analysis SHOULD consider:

-   referenced contracts
-   interface identity
-   logical types
-   required inputs
-   declared outputs

Version identifiers alone SHALL NOT determine compatibility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Interface Validation

Implementations SHALL validate:

explicitly authorized by the Pipeline Contract.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Extensibility

The Pipeline Interface MAY be extended through the DPCS Extensibility
Model.

Extensions SHALL preserve standardized interface semantics and SHALL NOT
redefine mandatory interface behavior.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 11. Conformance

A conforming implementation SHALL:

-   preserve interface identity
-   preserve declared inputs and outputs
-   preserve contract references
-   validate interface integrity
-   reject invalid interfaces through standardized Diagnostics

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 12. Summary

The Pipeline Interface Model defines the contractual boundary between a
Pipeline Contract and the systems with which it interacts.

By standardizing pipeline interfaces independently of orchestration
technology, DPCS enables portable pipeline definitions whose externally
observable behavior remains consistent across conforming
implementations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Chapter 5 --- Pipeline Graph

## 1. Purpose

This chapter defines the normative Pipeline Graph Model for the Data
Pipeline Contract Standard (DPCS).

A Pipeline Graph describes the logical dependency relationships among
Pipeline Steps. It defines how work is composed within a Pipeline
Contract while remaining independent of any specific orchestration
technology or execution strategy.

Unless explicitly identified as informative, all requirements in this
chapter are normative.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Design Goals

The Pipeline Graph Model SHALL be:

-   implementation independent
-   deterministic
-   machine readable
-   analyzable
-   extensible
-   semantically preserving

The Pipeline Graph SHALL describe logical dependencies rather than
implementation-specific scheduling behavior.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Graph Model

Every Pipeline Contract SHALL define exactly one Pipeline Graph.

The Pipeline Graph SHALL consist of:

-   Pipeline Steps
-   dependency relationships
-   graph metadata
-   graph entry points
-   graph exit points

The graph SHALL define the complete logical execution topology of the
Pipeline Contract.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Graph Topology

The Pipeline Graph SHALL represent directed relationships between
Pipeline Steps.

Each relationship SHALL explicitly identify:

-   source step
-   destination step
-   dependency type

The interpretation of dependency types SHALL be defined by this
specification or approved extensions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Directed Acyclic Graphs

The standard execution model for DPCS SHALL be a Directed Acyclic Graph
(DAG).

Unless explicitly permitted by a DPCS profile or extension, Pipeline
Graphs SHALL NOT contain cycles.

Implementations SHALL detect prohibited cycles during validation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Branching and Merging

A Pipeline Graph MAY contain:

-   branches
-   merges
-   fan-out operations
-   fan-in operations

Branching semantics SHALL be explicitly represented within the graph
structure and SHALL NOT depend upon serialization order.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Parallelism

Independent Pipeline Steps MAY execute concurrently.

The Pipeline Graph expresses logical dependencies only and SHALL NOT
prescribe a scheduling algorithm or concurrency model.

Implementations MAY choose any execution strategy that preserves
observable semantics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Subgraphs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 13. Summary

The Pipeline Graph Model provides the logical execution topology for a
Pipeline Contract.

By separating dependency semantics from orchestration technology, DPCS
enables portable, analyzable, and interoperable pipeline definitions
whose observable behavior remains consistent across conforming
implementations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Chapter 6 --- Pipeline Steps

## 1. Purpose

This chapter defines the normative Pipeline Step Model for the Data
Pipeline Contract Standard (DPCS).

A Pipeline Step is the fundamental executable unit within a Pipeline
Contract. Pipeline Steps define *what* logical operation occurs within a
pipeline while remaining independent of any specific orchestration
platform or execution technology.

Unless explicitly identified as informative, all requirements in this
chapter are normative.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Design Goals

The Pipeline Step Model SHALL be:

-   implementation independent
-   contract first
-   machine readable
-   deterministic where declared
-   composable

Pipeline Steps SHALL define logical behavior rather than
implementation-specific execution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Pipeline Step Model

Every Pipeline Step SHALL define:

-   a stable identifier
-   a step type
-   declared inputs
-   declared outputs
-   dependency relationships

-   a nested Pipeline Contract
-   a data ingress operation
-   a data egress operation
-   an implementation-defined operation provided through a DPCS
    extension

The semantic meaning of every step type SHALL be explicitly defined.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Inputs and Outputs

Every Pipeline Step SHALL declare its logical inputs and outputs.

Inputs and outputs SHALL reference pipeline interfaces, intermediate
datasets, or externally referenced contracts.

Implementations SHALL validate that every required input is satisfiable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Dependency Relationships

Pipeline Steps SHALL declare logical dependencies through the Pipeline
Graph defined in Chapter 5.

Dependencies SHALL express ordering constraints and SHALL NOT prescribe
scheduling algorithms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Nested Pipelines

A Pipeline Step MAY reference another Pipeline Contract.

Nested Pipeline Contracts SHALL preserve their own interfaces,
identities, and semantic boundaries.

Implementations SHALL preserve parent-child relationships during
planning and orchestrator binding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Validation

Implementations SHALL validate:

-   preserve declared interfaces
-   preserve dependency semantics
-   reject invalid Pipeline Steps through standardized Diagnostics

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 13. Summary

The Pipeline Step Model defines the fundamental building blocks from
which Pipeline Contracts are composed.

By separating logical pipeline operations from execution technologies,
DPCS enables portable, analyzable, and interoperable pipeline
definitions that can be planned, validated, and bound to multiple
orchestration platforms while preserving identical observable semantics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Chapter 7 --- Contract References

## 1. Purpose

This chapter defines the normative Contract Reference Model for the Data
Pipeline Contract Standard (DPCS).

Contract References enable a Pipeline Contract to compose existing
contracts without duplicating their definitions. A Pipeline Contract
SHALL reference external contracts through stable identifiers while
preserving the independent lifecycle, versioning, and semantics of each
referenced contract.

Unless explicitly identified as informative, all requirements in this
chapter are normative.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Design Goals

The Contract Reference Model SHALL be:

-   implementation independent

Implementations SHALL resolve Contract References before pipeline
planning.

Resolution MAY occur through:

-   local files
-   registries
-   package repositories
-   network services
-   implementation-defined mechanisms

The resolution mechanism SHALL NOT alter the semantic meaning of the
referenced contract.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Version and Compatibility

Every Contract Reference SHOULD declare version requirements.

Implementations SHALL evaluate compatibility independently of version
identifiers.

A resolved contract SHALL satisfy all mandatory compatibility
requirements before successful validation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Identity Preservation

Referenced contracts SHALL retain:

-   contract identity
-   version identity

reusable Data Contracts, Transformation Contracts, and Pipeline
Contracts while preserving their independent identities and semantics.

By standardizing contract composition rather than duplication, DPCS
supports modular, portable, and governable pipeline definitions across
heterogeneous execution environments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Chapter 8 --- Data Flow

## 1. Purpose

This chapter defines the normative Data Flow Model for the Data Pipeline
Contract Standard (DPCS).

The Data Flow Model specifies how datasets move through a Pipeline
Contract. It describes logical movement and dependency relationships
independently of storage systems, transport mechanisms, execution
engines, or orchestration technologies.

Intermediate datasets MAY or MAY NOT be physically materialized.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Materialization

Whether a dataset is materialized is an implementation decision unless
explicitly required by a Pipeline Contract or DPCS profile.

Materialization SHALL NOT change the observable semantics of the
Pipeline Contract.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Data Dependencies

Data Flow SHALL establish logical dependencies between Pipeline Steps.

Implementations SHALL use declared Data Flow relationships during
planning and validation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 12. Conformance

A conforming implementation SHALL:

-   preserve dataset identities
-   preserve Data Flow relationships
-   validate flow integrity
-   preserve declared contract references
-   reject invalid Data Flow definitions through standardized
    Diagnostics

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 13. Summary

The Data Flow Model defines the logical movement of datasets through a
Pipeline Contract.

By separating logical data movement from physical execution and storage,
DPCS enables portable pipeline definitions that preserve identical
observable semantics across heterogeneous orchestration platforms and
execution environments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Chapter 9 --- Control Flow

## 1. Purpose

This chapter defines the normative Control Flow Model for the Data
Pipeline Contract Standard (DPCS).

The Control Flow Model specifies the logical ordering and coordination
of Pipeline Steps within a Pipeline Contract. It defines execution
intent independently of orchestration technologies, scheduling
algorithms, or runtime implementations.

Unless explicitly identified as informative, all requirements in this
chapter are normative.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Design Goals

The Control Flow Model SHALL be:

-   implementation independent
-   deterministic where declared
-   machine readable
-   analyzable
-   semantically preserving
-   extensible

Control Flow SHALL describe logical execution constraints rather than
implementation-specific scheduling behavior.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Control Flow Model

Control Flow defines the logical ordering of Pipeline Steps.

Every Control Flow relationship SHALL be explicitly represented through
the Pipeline Graph and associated dependency metadata.

Control Flow SHALL coordinate execution without modifying the semantic
behavior of individual Pipeline Steps.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Sequential Execution

Pipeline Steps MAY execute sequentially.

Sequential execution SHALL require that predecessor steps complete
successfully before dependent steps begin unless otherwise specified by
a DPCS profile or extension.

Sequential relationships SHALL be explicitly represented.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Parallel Execution

Independent Pipeline Steps MAY execute concurrently.

Parallel execution SHALL be permitted only when no declared dependency
relationship requires ordering.

Implementations MAY choose any scheduling strategy that preserves
observable semantics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Conditional Execution

A Pipeline Contract MAY define conditional execution paths.

Conditions SHALL be expressed declaratively.

Conditional behavior SHALL preserve deterministic semantics when
equivalent inputs and evaluation contexts are provided.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Synchronization

Control Flow MAY require synchronization between Pipeline Steps.

Synchronization points SHALL explicitly identify the required
predecessor relationships.

Synchronization semantics SHALL remain independent of orchestration
technology.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Event-Driven Execution

Pipeline Contracts MAY declare that execution is initiated by one or
more events.

Event definitions SHALL describe logical triggering conditions rather
than implementation-specific event mechanisms.

By separating execution requirements from orchestration technologies and
infrastructure implementations, DPCS enables portable pipeline
definitions whose execution intent can be satisfied across diverse
computing environments while preserving consistent semantic behavior.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Chapter 11 --- Scheduling Intent

## 1. Purpose

This chapter defines the normative Scheduling Intent Model for the Data
Pipeline Contract Standard (DPCS).

Scheduling Intent expresses *when* and *under what logical conditions* a

By separating execution intent from scheduling implementation, DPCS
enables portable pipeline definitions that can be bound to diverse
orchestration systems while preserving identical observable scheduling
semantics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Chapter 12 --- Quality Gates

## 1. Purpose

This chapter defines the normative Quality Gate Model for the Data
Pipeline Contract Standard (DPCS).

Quality Gates establish explicit decision points within a Pipeline
Contract where declared conditions SHALL be evaluated before pipeline

By separating quality intent from implementation-specific validation
technologies, DPCS enables portable pipelines whose governance,
compliance, and acceptance criteria remain consistent across
heterogeneous orchestration platforms and execution environments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Chapter 13 --- Failure Semantics

## 1. Purpose

This chapter defines the normative Failure Semantics Model for the Data
Pipeline Contract Standard (DPCS).

metadata, DPCS enables portable, interoperable, and auditable pipeline
definitions that preserve end-to-end traceability across heterogeneous
orchestration platforms and execution environments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Chapter 15 --- Pipeline Plan

## 1. Purpose

This chapter defines the normative Pipeline Plan Model for the Data
Pipeline Contract Standard (DPCS).

    Diagnostics

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 12. Summary

The Orchestrator Capability Model establishes a standardized description
of orchestration platform capabilities independent of any specific
implementation.

By separating capability discovery from orchestration binding, DPCS
enables portable Pipeline Plans to be evaluated objectively against
multiple execution platforms while preserving consistent observable
semantics.

-   preserve registry and extension identities
-   produce standardized Diagnostics for invalid governance declarations

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 13. Summary

The Governance Model provides a stable framework for the stewardship and
long-term evolution of the Data Pipeline Contract Standard.

By defining transparent processes for specification maintenance,
publication, registry management, and extension oversight, DPCS promotes
a healthy ecosystem in which independent implementations can evolve
while preserving interoperability, portability, and semantic
consistency.

# Chapter 26 --- Appendices

## 1. Purpose

This chapter contains informative appendices that support implementation
of the Data Pipeline Contract Standard (DPCS). Unless explicitly stated
otherwise, the material in this chapter is informative and does not
introduce additional normative requirements beyond those defined in
Chapters 1--25.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Appendix A --- Glossary

**Artifact** --- A versioned object defined or referenced by DPCS.

**Canonical Object Model (COM)** --- The implementation-independent
in-memory representation of a Pipeline Contract.

**Contract Reference** --- A reference to an external contract such as
an ODCS Data Contract, DTCS Transformation Contract, or another DPCS
Pipeline Contract.

**Orchestrator Binding** --- The translation of a validated Pipeline
Plan into platform-specific orchestration artifacts.

**Pipeline Contract** --- The normative declaration describing a
pipeline.

**Pipeline Plan** --- The canonical intermediate representation produced
from a validated Pipeline Contract.

**Pipeline Step** --- A logical unit of work within a Pipeline Contract.

## Appendix B --- Example Pipeline Contract (YAML)

``` yaml
dpcsVersion: "1.0.0"
id: "customer-pipeline"
version: "1.0.0"

inputs:
  - id: customer_raw
    contractRef: contracts/customer_raw.odcs.yaml

steps:
  - id: normalize
    transformRef: transforms/normalize.dtcs.yaml

outputs:
  - id: customer_clean
    contractRef: contracts/customer_clean.odcs.yaml
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Summary

These appendices provide reference material, examples, architectural
diagrams, terminology, and implementation guidance intended to help
implementers build interoperable DPCS tooling while remaining faithful
to the normative requirements established throughout this specification.
