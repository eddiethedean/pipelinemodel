# Orchestration Plugins

Orchestration plugins bind a validated **Pipeline Plan** to a workflow
orchestration platform.

PipelineModel does not embed Airflow, Dagster, Prefect, or any other scheduler
into its core. Instead, orchestration plugins translate the implementation-
independent Pipeline Plan into runtime-specific workflows while preserving the
pipeline's declared semantics.

## Goals

Orchestration plugins should:

- Preserve DPCS semantics.
- Remain independent of pipeline modeling.
- Support multiple orchestration platforms.
- Declare capabilities explicitly.
- Generate deterministic orchestration artifacts.
- Fail when mandatory semantics cannot be preserved.

## Philosophy

PipelineModel defines **what** the pipeline means.

Orchestration plugins define **where and how** it is coordinated.

```text

```

Each plugin produces an equivalent workflow for its target platform.

## Why Plugins?

Separating orchestration from modeling provides:

- Vendor independence
- Easier testing
- Cleaner APIs
- Multiple deployment targets
- Future extensibility

Pipeline definitions never depend on orchestrator APIs.

## Supported Platforms

PipelineModel is designed to support plugins for:

- Local execution
- Airflow
- Dagster
- Prefect
- Argo Workflows
- Azure Data Factory
- AWS Step Functions
- Future orchestrators

## Capability Matching

Each orchestration plugin publishes the capabilities it supports.

Examples include:

- Scheduling
- Parallel execution
- Retries
- Checkpoints
- Event triggers
- Approval workflows
- Compensation
- Dynamic branching

During planning, PipelineModel compares pipeline requirements against plugin
capabilities.

Planning or binding should fail if a required capability is unavailable.

## Binding

Binding converts a Pipeline Plan into a platform-specific representation.

Examples include:

- Airflow DAG
- Dagster Definitions
- Prefect Flow
- Argo Workflow
- Deployment manifests

Bindings must preserve:

- Graph topology
- Step identities
- Dependencies
- Scheduling intent
- Failure semantics
- Quality gates
- Lineage
- Contract references

## Scheduling

Scheduling is part of the orchestration layer—not the pipeline definition.

Profiles may select:

- Manual execution
- Cron schedules
- Event-driven execution
- Dependency-triggered execution

The orchestration plugin maps these requirements to the target platform.

## Resource Management

Plugins coordinate runtime resources such as:

- Worker pools
- Queues
- Compute resources
- Secrets
- External services

Resources are resolved through profiles and bindings rather than embedded in
pipeline contracts.

## Observability

Plugins should expose execution events including:

- Pipeline started
- Step started
- Step completed
- Step failed
- Retry
- Pipeline completed

Events should reference stable pipeline and step identities.

## Best Practices

- Preserve observable semantics.
- Declare capabilities explicitly.
- Keep orchestrator-specific configuration out of pipelines.
- Validate bindings before deployment.
- Generate deterministic artifacts.

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid:

- Writing Airflow-specific pipeline definitions.
- Encoding scheduler logic in transformation contracts.
- Silently ignoring unsupported features.
- Changing graph semantics during binding.

## Key Principle

> Orchestration plugins coordinate execution of a Pipeline Plan on a specific
platform while preserving the portable semantics defined by DPCS.
