# Run Reports

> **Status: Available in ETLantic 0.10.** Every successful or failed local
> (and plugin-backed) run returns a structured `PipelineRunReport`.

Every ETLantic run returns a structured `PipelineRunReport`.

The report is the canonical, backend-independent summary of what was planned,
executed, produced, validated, retried, skipped, and failed. It is
**secret-free** and process-local unless you persist it yourself—do not treat
it as an audit system of record.

## Basic Usage

```python
report = CustomerPipeline.run(profile="development")

print(report.status)
print(report.duration)
print(report.summary)

for step in report.steps:
    print(step.step_id, step.status, step.duration_seconds)
```

Async execution returns the same model:

```python
report = await CustomerPipeline.arun(profile="development")
```

## Report Versus Result

ETLantic uses one public run object:

```text
PipelineRunReport
├── normalized execution result
├── step and artifact results
├── validation and state results
├── diagnostics
├── plan summary
└── rendering helpers (to_text / to_dict / to_html)
```

Internal plugins may produce narrower result objects, but the public run API
normalizes them into `PipelineRunReport`.

The report is data, not console output. Text, JSON, HTML, and other formats are
renderings of the same model.

## Shipped Model

Canonical fields live on `etlantic.reports.PipelineRunReport`
(`schema = "etlantic.run_report/1"`):

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class PipelineRunReport:
    pipeline_id: str
    plan_id: str
    run_id: str
    intent: RunIntent
    profile: str
    status: RunStatus
    started_at: datetime
    pipeline_version: str | None = None
    ended_at: datetime | None = None
    duration: timedelta | None = None
    summary: RunSummary = ...
    steps: tuple[StepRunReport, ...] = ()
    artifacts: tuple[ArtifactResult, ...] = ()
    validations: tuple[ValidationResult, ...] = ()
    state_transitions: tuple[StateTransitionResult, ...] = ()
    diagnostics: tuple[RunDiagnostic, ...] = ()
    recommendations: tuple[RunRecommendation, ...] = ()
    backend_runs: tuple[BackendRunReference, ...] = ()
    schema_observations: tuple[SchemaObservationResult, ...] = ()
    lineage: tuple[dict[str, str], ...] = ()
    plan_fingerprint: str | None = None
    metadata: dict[str, Any] = ...
```

See the API reference and `src/etlantic/reports/model.py` for nested types.

## Run Summary

`RunSummary` provides the fast overview (field names as shipped):

```python
RunSummary(
    total_steps=8,
    succeeded=7,
    failed=0,
    skipped=1,
    cancelled=0,
    retried=1,
    records_in=150_000,
    records_out=149_850,
)
```

Counts may be unavailable or expensive for some backends. Unknown values must
remain `None`; ETLantic must not report zero when the backend did not
measure them.

## Step Reports

Each logical step receives its own report even when several steps are fused
into one SQL statement or Spark execution region.

```python
from etlantic.reports import StepRunReport
from etlantic.runtime.state import StepStatus

StepRunReport(
    step_id="step:normalize_customers",
    step_name="normalize_customers",
    status=StepStatus.SUCCEEDED,
    attempts=1,
    started_at=...,
    ended_at=...,
    duration_seconds=0.12,
    implementation="polars",
    records_in=2,
    records_out=2,
    metadata={},
)
```

Shipped `StepRunReport` fields include step identity/name, status, attempts,
timing (`started_at`, `ended_at`, `duration_seconds`), optional record counts,
`implementation`, `failure_stage` / `error_message`, and secret-free
`metadata`. Additional physical-unit or plugin fields may appear in metadata
when the runtime records them.

## Previous-Step Results

Reports make direct result reuse visible:

```python
ArtifactTransferReport(
    producer="normalize_customers.result",
    consumer="score_customers.customers",
    strategy="native_lazy_reference",
    materialized=False,
    reused=True,
)
```

This lets users distinguish:

- direct in-memory or lazy reuse
- SQL relation or CTE reuse
- Spark logical-plan reuse
- cache hits
- checkpoint reuse
- durable artifact transfer
- rereads from external source bindings

## Validation Results

Quality reporting includes:

```python
ValidationResult(
    boundary="normalize_customers.result",
    contract_id="customer",
    policy="production",
    evaluated_records=10_000,
    valid_records=9_970,
    invalid_records=30,
    pass_rate=0.997,
    threshold=0.995,
    passed=True,
    valid_artifact=...,
    invalid_artifact=...,
    findings=(...),
)
```

The report must not embed rejected records by default. It references the
invalid artifact when policy permits one to be produced.

## Run Intents and State

Incremental and backfill runs should report:

- requested run intent
- effective strategy
- state read
- cursor or watermark range
- overlap or replay window
- state commit outcome
- whether state advancement was withheld

```python
StateTransitionResult(
    strategy="watermark",
    before="2026-07-15T00:00:00Z",
    candidate="2026-07-16T00:00:00Z",
    committed="2026-07-16T00:00:00Z",
    status="committed",
)
```

Sensitive state values may be redacted or summarized.

## Diagnostics and Recommendations

The report includes stable diagnostics:

```text
PMEXEC301: Step retry succeeded on attempt 2.
PMART214: Result was materialized because it crosses an Airflow task boundary.
PMVAL402: 30 invalid records were routed to quarantine.
```

Recommendations are advisory and separately typed:

```python
RunRecommendation(
    code="PMPERF101",
    message="Output is reused by four consumers; consider persistence.",
    step_id="normalize_customers",
)
```

Recommendations never change execution automatically.

## Backend References

Reports should link to external execution systems when available:

```python
BackendRunReference(
    backend="airflow",
    run_id="scheduled__2026-07-16T...",
    url="https://airflow.example/dags/customer/grid?...",
)
```

Similar references may point to:

- Spark applications
- Databricks jobs
- SQL query history
- cloud logs
- traces
- lineage systems

## Rendering

The report supports deterministic renderers:

```python
report.to_dict()
report.to_json()
report.to_text()
report.to_html()
```

CLI examples:

```bash
etlantic run customer.py:CustomerPipeline --profile development
etlantic run customer.py:CustomerPipeline --profile development --format json
```

`etlantic report show` / `report export` read the **process-local** report
store for that CLI invocation. A new process does not see earlier runs unless
you persist reports yourself.

HTML reports may add diagrams and styling, but they consume the same canonical
report model.

## Durable Run History

Use `FileReportStore` when reports must survive process boundaries:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from etlantic.reports.file_store import FileReportStore

store = FileReportStore(Path("reports"))
# After Pipeline.run(...):
# store.put(run_report)
# later:
# store.get(run_report.run_id)
```

The in-process store remains available:

```python
runtime.reports.get(run_id)
runtime.reports.list(pipeline_id="customer_pipeline")
```

Durable history enables:

- execution trends
- quality trends
- performance regression detection
- anomaly detection
- audit evidence
- comparison between profiles and backends

Persistence is provider-owned. `PipelineRunReport` remains provider-neutral.

## Partial and External Runs

Reports must represent incomplete knowledge:

- submitted but still running
- cancelled
- timed out
- abandoned after losing backend contact
- partially successful
- external backend reports unavailable

A report may be updated through immutable snapshots:

```python
snapshot = handle.report()
final_report = await handle.wait()
```

The final state must not be inferred solely from missing errors.

## Security

Reports must exclude:

- secret values
- credential-bearing connection strings
- raw environment snapshots
- raw invalid records
- unbounded backend logs

Plan configuration and backend metadata must be redacted before inclusion.

## Compatibility

The serialized report schema should be versioned independently:

```python
report.schema_version
```

Additive fields may be introduced compatibly. Removing fields or changing their
meaning requires a major report-schema version.

## Relationship to SparkForge

ETLantic preserves SparkForge's useful reporting concepts:

- run ID and mode
- timestamps and duration
- total, successful, failed, and skipped steps
- step-level timing and status
- rows processed and written
- validation rates
- write and table metadata
- warnings and recommendations
- durable execution history

It generalizes them by:

- removing bronze, silver, and gold report sections
- supporting named outputs and direct step-result references
- separating logical steps from fused physical units
- allowing unknown metrics
- including artifacts, state transitions, retries, and backend links
- remaining consistent across SQL, PySpark, Polars, Pandas, and orchestrators

## Key Principle

> Every run returns one structured, backend-independent report. Renderers,
> observability providers, and external runtimes enrich that report without
> changing its portable meaning.

## Portable Transformation Evidence (0.12+)

When a portable definition is selected, each logical step report records the
implementation kind, portable protocol and definition fingerprint, compiler
package/engine/version, capability decision summary, and any explicit native
fallback reason. Materialization and ownership decisions introduced by
lowering remain visible.

Reports never include source rows, sensitive runtime parameter values,
compiled closures, or backend-native expression objects.
