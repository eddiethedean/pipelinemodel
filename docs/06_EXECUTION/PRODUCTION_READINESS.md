# Production Readiness and Deployment Boundaries

ETLantic 0.21.0 is production/stable for the documented single-tenant reference
deployment on this page. Experimental features remain experimental. Broader
deployment topology, multi-tenancy, compliance attestations beyond shipped
SBOM digests/GitHub attestations, and advanced supply-chain programs remain
adopter-owned.

## Supported reference shape

```text
Version-pinned application process / container
  ├─ ETLantic core: model, validate, plan
  ├─ Explicitly allowlisted official plugins
  ├─ External secret provider at runtime
  ├─ External storage / engine
  └─ External orchestrator or supervised local process
```

Supported deployments are single-team or single-tenant, process-isolated, and
reproducible. Adopters own data-classification controls. ETLantic does not
provide multi-tenant process isolation, a distributed scheduler, durable
control-plane state, or an SLA.

## Reference single-process topology

1. Pin `etlantic==0.21.0` and matching plugins in a lockfile.
2. Build an immutable image or venv; do not install untrusted entry points.
3. Configure `Profile.plugin_allowlist` for production.
4. Resolve secrets from env/files/keyring at runtime only.
5. Persist plans, reports, and compiled DAGs to application-owned storage.
6. Run `etlantic validate … --format sarif` in CI before deploy.
7. Health-check the process with your supervisor (ETLantic has no built-in HTTP
   health endpoint).
8. On upgrade: pin forward, re-validate, re-plan, smoke-run one pipeline, keep
   the previous lockfile for rollback.

Airflow workers that execute compiled DAGs must install the same core/plugin
versions used at compile time, plus Airflow itself. Compilation does not ship
engine wheels to workers.

## Required controls

| Control | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Versions | Pin core and official plugins to the same tested release |
| Plugin trust | Set a non-empty `Profile.plugin_allowlist` in production |
| Install surface | Treat entry-point discovery as import-time execution; allowlists are selection controls |
| Secrets | Resolve at runtime; never embed values in plans or reports |
| Isolation | Use separate OS processes or containers for trust boundaries |
| Artifacts | Store plans, reports, and compiled DAGs under application controls |
| Validation | Run `etlantic validate` before plan, compile, or execution |
| Observability | Export logs/reports to an application-owned durable system |
| Recovery | Define engine-specific retries and idempotency outside assumptions |
| Retention | Define report/plan retention and filesystem ownership yourself |

## Boundaries on a general production claim

These remain outside the unrestricted enterprise envelope even when single-tenant
reference controls are shipped:

- Cross-tenant / multi-tenant isolation guarantees (beyond single-tenant keys)
- Formal denial-of-service capacity SLAs (partial I/O budgets only)
- Compliance-grade audit system of record (CLI reports are operational evidence)
- Stable 1.0 compatibility and support windows
- HA/DR, RPO/RTO, and compliance attestations (adopter-owned)
- Broader supply-chain programs beyond package allowlists, pins, SBOM digests,
  and GitHub attestations

## Shipped / adopter-owned / residual (0.21)

| Concern | 0.21 status |
|---|---|
| Typed validate/plan/run | **Shipped** |
| Portable compilers (Polars/Pandas/SQL/PySpark) | **Shipped** |
| Plugin allowlists | **Shipped** (selection, not sandbox) |
| Safe I/O, outbound default-deny, serialization ban | **Shipped** |
| Artifact/cache isolation keys (single-tenant) | **Shipped** |
| Release SBOM digests + GitHub attestations | **Shipped** |
| Durable multi-worker / multi-tenant control plane | **Residual / gap** |
| Cross-tenant isolation guarantees | **Residual / adopter-owned** |
| Capacity / performance SLA | **Gap** — local baselines only |
| Compliance audit SoR | **Adopter-owned** |

## Deployment acceptance criteria

A deployment review should record supported versions, validation results, plan
fingerprints, plugin capability decisions, observed run reports, recovery
behavior, performance overhead, and every accepted security gap. Do not expand
beyond the bounded envelope if any required backend semantic is silently
degraded.
