# Ops Pilot Guide

> **Status: Production/stable in ETLantic 0.21.0 for the documented
> single-tenant reference deployment.** This is not a multi-tenant deployment
> product.

Use this page for a **bounded deployment**: one team or tenant, pinned packages,
process isolation, and fail-closed production profiles. SLA, HA, deployment
topology, compliance/SBOM/signing, and advanced supply-chain controls remain
adopter-owned.

## Pin matrix

```bash
pip install 'etlantic==0.22.0'
# Only the engines you need:
pip install 'etlantic-polars==0.22.0'   # or pandas / sql / pyspark / airflow / prefect
```

Record the exact versions in your lockfile. Production profiles should pin
plugins via `Profile.plugin_allowlist` (bare versions are accepted as
`==version`).

## Required controls

1. **Non-empty `plugin_allowlist`** on production / `security_domain=production`
2. **No secrets** in plans, reports, CI logs, or schema history
3. **Process isolation** — do not multi-tenant in one process
4. **SARIF validate** in CI before compile/generate

Use an explicit allowlisted profile file (the built-in name
`production` is empty and fail-closed). See
[Production profiles](PRODUCTION_PROFILES.md).

```bash
etlantic validate path/to/pipeline.py:MyPipeline \
  --profile ./profiles/prod.json --format sarif
etlantic plan path/to/pipeline.py:MyPipeline \
  --profile ./profiles/prod.json --format json
```

## Runtime configuration

- Profiles: [Profiles](../05_PIPELINES/PROFILES.md)
- Env / Profile knobs: [Runtime configuration](../10_REFERENCE/RUNTIME_CONFIGURATION.md)
- Secrets: env or mounted file providers; optional `etlantic-keyring`

## Reports and observability

- Run reports default to durable `.etlantic/reports/` (pass `--ephemeral` for
  process-local). They are operational evidence, not an audit system of
  record. Use `etlantic report list` / `show` / `export` across invocations.
- Optional OpenTelemetry adapter: `pip install 'etlantic[otel]'` — see
  [Capabilities](../01_GETTING_STARTED/CAPABILITIES.md).

## Airflow handoff

1. Plan with a production profile and allowlist that includes your orchestrator
2. `etlantic compile TARGET --target airflow -o dags/ --profile ./profiles/prod.json`
3. Deploy the generated DAG with your normal Airflow process

Ownership: ETLantic owns modeling, validation, and the secret-free plan;
Airflow owns scheduling and worker execution; engines own dataframe/SQL/Spark
compute.

## Failure ownership

| Symptom | Likely owner |
|---|---|
| Validation / `PMPLUG*` / wiring diagnostics | ETLantic model / profile |
| Engine OOM, SQL errors, Spark job failure | Engine / plugin / infrastructure |
| DAG not scheduled | Airflow / ops |
| Secret resolution failure | Secret provider / mount / env |
