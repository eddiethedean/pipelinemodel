# etlantic-sparkforge

SparkForge → ETLantic migration adapter for ETLantic 0.14.

SparkForge remains the medallion-facing facade (bronze / silver / gold).
This package maps those conventions onto ordinary ETLantic `Source` / `Step` /
`Sink`, `Profile`, `RunSelection` / `RunIntent`, and `PipelineRunReport`
surfaces. **ETLantic core never gains medallion types.**

## Install

```bash
pip install 'etlantic==0.14.0' 'etlantic-sparkforge==0.14.0'
# or
pip install 'etlantic[sparkforge]'
```

0.14 ships an **IR-only** adapter: feed `SparkForgePipelineSpec` (JSON/YAML
fixtures or hand-built dataclasses). There is **no** live
`pipeline_builder` / SparkForge Python API bridge in this release.

The adapter is registered explicitly by importing `etlantic_sparkforge` and
calling its conversion helpers. The adapted result supplies an ordinary
ETLantic pipeline and profile; select execution plugins such as
`Profile.spark_engine="pyspark"` separately. Production profiles must
allowlist every trusted execution plugin.

## Quick start (IR → Pipeline)

```python
from etlantic_sparkforge import (
    SparkForgePipelineSpec,
    SparkForgeStepSpec,
    StepKind,
    LayerKind,
    adapt_pipeline,
    debug_request_from_sparkforge,
    enrich_plan,
)
from etlantic.plan import plan_pipeline

spec = SparkForgePipelineSpec(
    name="ecommerce",
    schema="demo",
    steps=(
        SparkForgeStepSpec(
            name="orders",
            kind=StepKind.BRONZE_RULES,
            layer=LayerKind.BRONZE,
            table_name="bronze_orders",
        ),
        SparkForgeStepSpec(
            name="clean_orders",
            kind=StepKind.SILVER_TRANSFORM,
            layer=LayerKind.SILVER,
            source="orders",
            table_name="silver_orders",
            write_mode="overwrite",
        ),
    ),
)
adapted = adapt_pipeline(spec)
adapted.pipeline_cls.validate(profile=adapted.profile)
plan = enrich_plan(
    plan_pipeline(adapted.pipeline_cls, profile=adapted.profile),
    adapted,
)
request = debug_request_from_sparkforge(mode="incremental", skip_writes=True)
```

## Progressive engine deprecation path

1. **Plan-only** — generate/inspect ETLantic plans from SparkForge IR
   (`strict_delta=False` to warn instead of fail when Delta caps are unknown)
2. **Dual reporting** — `adapt_run_result` → `PipelineRunReport`
3. **ETLantic planning** — selections/intents via `debug_request_from_sparkforge`
4. **Plugin execution** — `Profile.spark_engine="pyspark"` / SQL plugins
5. **Facade** — SparkForge keeps medallion builder; retire duplicated engines

`transform_ref` / bronze `rules` emit `PMSF411` warnings: the adapter builds
passthrough transforms for planning parity; it does not execute SparkForge
callables. Write intents (including MERGE) are attached via `enrich_plan` for
orchestration; the local runtime still gates materialization with
`RunRequest.no_write`.
