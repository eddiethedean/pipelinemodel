## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability.

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting when it is enabled for the
repository. If it is unavailable, contact the repository owner privately
through the verified contact listed in the package metadata and request a
secure reporting channel before sending sensitive details.

Include:

- Affected version and component
- Security impact
- Minimal reproduction steps
- Relevant non-secret configuration
- Suggested mitigation, when known

Never include production credentials, customer data, regulated records, or
live exploit targets.

## Scope

Security-sensitive areas include:

- Unsafe contract or configuration parsing
- Path traversal
- Arbitrary code execution outside explicitly registered implementations
- Secret disclosure in plans, logs, reports, exceptions, or generated files
- Storage binding and plugin supply-chain vulnerabilities
- Cross-run artifact, cache, or report exposure
- Injection vulnerabilities

The detailed threat model is documented in
[docs/02_FOUNDATIONS/SECURITY.md](docs/02_FOUNDATIONS/SECURITY.md).

## Disclosure

The project follows coordinated disclosure: acknowledge the report, assess
impact, prepare and test a fix, publish an upgrade, and then disclose technical
details at an appropriate time.

Formal response-time guarantees are not available during the alpha series.
