# Security Policy

ETLantic 0.15.0 is an alpha release. Security reports concerning the
published package, contract loading, planning, local runtime, storage
bindings, secret handling, dataframe, SQL, and PySpark plugins,
documentation, or repository automation are welcome.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Support |
|---|---|
| 0.15.x | Current alpha line (published); best-effort security fixes |
| 0.14.x and earlier | Not actively maintained; upgrade to 0.15.x |

Alpha releases do not guarantee backports across minor lines. Prefer upgrading
to the current published minor rather than requesting multi-line critical
fixes. Upgrade to the latest 0.15.x patch before reporting an issue.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability.

**Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting** for this repository
([Security advisories](https://github.com/eddiethedean/etlantic/security/advisories)).
If private reporting is temporarily unavailable, contact the maintainer listed
in [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) and request a secure channel before sending
sensitive details.

Include:

- Affected version and component
- Security impact
- Minimal reproduction steps
- Relevant non-secret configuration
- Suggested mitigation, when known

Never include production credentials, customer data, regulated records, or
live exploit targets.

## Scope

Security-sensitive areas include:

- Unsafe contract or configuration parsing
- Path traversal
- Arbitrary code execution outside explicitly registered implementations
- Secret disclosure in plans, logs, reports, exceptions, or generated files
- Storage binding and plugin supply-chain vulnerabilities
- Cross-run artifact, cache, or report exposure
- Injection vulnerabilities, including SQL identifier and parameter handling
  in SQL plugins (structured compilation and bound parameters; untrusted raw
  SQL is out of scope)

The detailed threat model is documented in
[docs/02_FOUNDATIONS/SECURITY.md](docs/02_FOUNDATIONS/SECURITY.md).

## Severity (informal)

| Severity | Examples |
|---|---|
| Critical | Remote code execution, credential exfiltration from plans/logs |
| High | Privilege escalation via plugins, path traversal writes |
| Medium | Fail-open trust controls, secret leakage in edge diagnostics |
| Low | Hardening gaps without practical exploit path |

## Disclosure

The project follows coordinated disclosure: acknowledge the report, assess
impact, prepare and test a fix, publish an upgrade, and then disclose technical
details at an appropriate time.

Target acknowledgement is seven days when possible. Formal response-time
guarantees and CVE assignment are not available during the alpha series.
Patch ownership sits with the lead maintainer ([MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md)).
If a release token is compromised, revoke it immediately, yank affected
artifacts if necessary, and publish a replacement after rotating credentials.
